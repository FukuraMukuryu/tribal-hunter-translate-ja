		"CatBoyABEACH1": "Hoi! Be careful!",
		"CatBoyABEACH2": "Those dragon guys up have hungry tails!",
		"CatBoyABEACH3": "They almost gobbled me up!",
		"CatBoyAHIVE1": "Haiii!",
		"CatBoyAHIVE2": "Look at this crazy place! So much honey!",
		"CatBoyAHIVE3": "Who knew there was such a huge ecosystem here!",
		"CatBoyAHIVE4": "I doubt these bees will be friendly though...",
		"CatBoyAHIVE5": "They appear to be very generous with their honey too...",
		"CatBoyAPLFORK1": "These pigs are resourceful, but also very lazy.",
		"CatBoyAPLFORK2": "Most of them will leave themselves open for attack!",
		"CatBoyAPLRESTA1": "Haiii! I see you've made it pretty far.",
		"CatBoyAPLRESTA2": "King Boarus isn't far from here.",
		"CatBoyAPLRESTA3": "He's a little further east.",
		"CatBoyAPLTHREE1": "Me and my team are spread all over the place.",
		"CatBoyAPLTHREE2": "If you find any of us, we might give you some useful information about your surroundings!",
		"CatBoyAMountFIVE1": "These ice guys look tough...",
		"CatBoyAMountFIVE2": "Theoretically they should be susceptible to fire, though!",
		"CatBoyAVillageFinal1": "Wow, you're quite the mysterious fella... fallin' from the sky like a star!",
		"CatBoyAVillageFinal2": "I hope you can solve this dilemma, there's so much more to discover here!",
		"CatBoyBCRYSTAL1": "This place has a strange way of lifting your spirits.",
		"CatBoyBCRYSTAL2": "The glow is very satisfying...",
		"CatBoyBCRYSTAL3": "The living crystals chasing you around, however... are not.",
		"CatBoyBGHOST1": "Stay near lanterns if you want to avoid the spirits.",
		"CatBoyBGHOST2": "They seem to really hate it...",
		"CatBoyBHIVE1": "I seemed to have gotten a bit ahead of myself...",
		"CatBoyBHIVE2": "I got poked by a bee and got bonked around like a balloon!",
		"CatBoyBHIVE3": "I bounced my way up here and managed to deflate, though...",
		"CatBoyBHIVE4": "The lesson in all this?",
		"CatBoyBHIVE5": "Plan your route accordingly.",
		"CatBoyBPLFORK1": "Hmm... This cliff seems impossible to climb.",
		"CatBoyBPLFORK2": "I heard the goat people know how to climb these steep walls.",
		"CatBoyBPLFORK3": "I wonder if they've ever visited this island...",
		"CatBoyBPLONE1": "Keep your eyes peeled for small mushrooms on the terrain...",
		"CatBoyBPLONE2": "They indicate magical mushrooms nearby!",
		"CatBoyBVillageFinal1": "I feel both dread and optimism...",
		"CatBoyBVillageFinal2": "The island feels like it wants to kill me and console me.",
		"CatBoyBVillageFinal3": "So spoooooooky.",
		"CatBoyCMOUNTFIVE1": "It sure is chilly up here...",
		"CatBoyCMOUNTFIVE2": "But watching all these bunnies made of snow is fun.",
		"CatBoyCMOUNTFIVE3": "Of course... I wouldn't want to get near them though...",
		"CatBoyCMOUNTFIVE4": "They're as ferocious as sharks.",
		"CatBoyCPLFOUR1": "Thanks for clearing that issue up.",
		"CatBoyCPLFOUR2": "I'll rest for a bit and move on.",
		"CatBoyCPLEIGHT1": "Oof... those shield-bearers are tough...",
		"CatBoyCPLEIGHT2": "Try to hit them from behind!",
		"CatBoyCWeightPlat1": "Hmm... I think this switch needs a heavy slam to open.",
		"CatBoyCWeightPlat2": "You could do it right? Just eat a bunch of food or slime!",
		"CatBoyCWeightPlat3": "450 pounds looks like it would be enough!",
		"CatBoyCWeightPlatB1": "Well done... you can get quite large!",
		"CatBoyCVillageFinal1": "We are prepared for this.",

		"DyeGirlVillage2": "Cute or menacing; I can do it all!",
		"DyeGirlVillageFinal1": "Ahh Munch!",
		"DyeGirlVillageFinal2": "Everyone is anxious for your final encounter with that crazy spirit!",
		"DyeGirlVillageFinal3": "Have you come to touch up your war paint?",
		"FarmerBearAllCow1": "At last, my farm is as it was!",
		"FarmerBearAllCow2": "Now we can achieve maximum efficiency together!",
		"FarmerBearAllCowFinal1": "I cannot thank you enough for all that you've done for me.",
		"FarmerBearAllCowFinal2": "As a token of friendship, and a boon for your hardship ahead... all remaining upgrades will be free to you.",
		"FarmerBearAllCowFinal3": "Do the village proud!",	
		"FarmerBearNoCow1": "My cows are all missing in the wild.",
		"FarmerBearNoCow2": "If you find them, would you please bring them back?",
		"FarmerBearNoCow3": "With them, I can imbue you with the greatness that is milk!",
		"FarmerBearNoCowFinal1": "My cows are out there just as frightened as I.",
		"FarmerBearNoCowFinal2": "I pray you will bring this conflict to a swift end so we may be reunited!",
		"FarmerBearSomeCow1": "There are still cows to be found.",
		"FarmerBearSomeCow2": "I can still aid you in your milk drinking experience for some coin, though!",
		"FarmerBearSomeCowFinal1": "Thank you for returning part of my family to me.",
		"FarmerBearSomeCowFinal2": "The final battle is at hand, so make sure your milk is as powerful as ever!",
		"gatorvillagefinal1": "I guess today decides if my beachfront properties gain or lose value, eh?",
		"gatorvillagefinal2": "I'm counting on ya to save the day!",
		"GrannyPostRescue1": "Give me a few moments to rest and I'll return to the village.",
		"GrannyPostRescue2": "I can't wait to light up my kitchen!",
		"Guest10cht1": "You look like you'd be a great wrestler!",
		"Guest10cht2": "You need more meat on your bones if you intend to enter the ring.",
		"Guest10cht3": "Let's have a sumo match some time!",
		"Guest11cht1": "People say magic's for wusses, but they're wrong!",
		"Guest11cht2": "This body is built by sorcery!",
		"Guest12cht1": "The flow of time is as fast as lightning.",
		"Guest12cht2": "Don't you think so too?",
		"Guest13cht1": "Hey pal, what are you staring at?",
		"Guest13cht2": "I'm trying to enjoy my food.",
		"Guest13cht3": "Oh... I just lost the game.",
		"Guest14cht1": "If you come across a cow derg, try putting some 3D glasses on him!",
		"Guest14cht2": "A friend of mine calls me Aldoughy, just don't get any ideas...",
		"Guest14cht3": "Heard the exotic slimes on this island make great drinks if you prepare them right.",
		"Guest15chtA1": "I'm looking for a friend of mine.",
		"Guest15chtA2": "He always calls me a cowderg...",
		"Guest15chtA3": "I don't see what he means by that.",
		"Guest15chtB1": "A friend of mine is on the island.",
		"Guest15chtB2": "He might look tough but he's essentially a doughball inside!",
		"Guest15chtC1": "I could totally go for a cheeseburger right now...",
		"Guest15chtC2": "Wait... what...?",
		"Guest16cht1": "You need somethin' sugar?",
		"Guest17cht1": "I wish Ginseng was here... He'd love these!",
		"Guest18cht1": "Mmh, Have you tried any of their deserts yet?",
		"Guest18cht2": "You should... they are very fattening and sweet!",
		"Guest19cht1": "Hey there, big boy. You must be this village's guardian.",
		"Guest19cht2": "I wanted to ask... can I draw a picture of you someday?",
		"Guest19cht3": "Also, be careful out there! I've been pummeled a lot.",
		"Guest1cht1": "If you happen to see a cute goat named Key, let him know I'm enjoying some ramen!",
		"Guest20cht1": "I come here for the fish because it's easier than catching them myself.",
		"Guest20cht2": "...W-what do you mean it's not free?",
		"Guest21cht1": "I swear, every time I eat here the servings get bigger!",
		"Guest22cht1": "You need to bulk up, kid.",
		"Guest22cht2": "Nothing beats a full belly in preparation for adventure.",
		"Guest22cht3": "It just takes me a while to fill up!",
		"Guest23cht1": "It gets wild out there, so I'll be in here.",
		"Guest23cht2": "Do you want some pancakes?",
		"Guest24cht1": "You know, I don't actually come here to eat!",
		"Guest24cht2": "I mean, I'm a robot so I can't eat...",
		"Guest24cht3": "Instead, I come to meet all the interesting and wonderful people that come here!",
		"Guest25cht1": "I heard the food here is the best in the whole archipelagos.",
		"Guest25cht2": "I wanted to try some before I continue my quest.",
		"Guest26cht1": "I don't understand how you do it...",
		"Guest26cht2": "I can barely put away one plate...!",
		"Guest27cht1": "I just thought of a great souvenir for this place!",
		"Guest27cht2": "A doll based off of the Island Guardian!",
		"Guest27cht3": "What's with that look?",
		"Guest27cht4": "Wouldn't you like one?",
		"Guest28cht1": "Normally, I prefer to not indulge in dishes with garlic...",
		"Guest28cht2": "But lately, I can't get enough of it!",
		"Guest29cht1": "Heya! Try the food, it's fantastic!",
		"Guest29cht2": "And you can't adventure on an empty stomach.",
		"Guest2cht1": "I heard you can change your size quickly... that's so cool!",
		"Guest2cht2": "Can you teach me how to do that?",
		"Guest30cht1": "I would eat pancakes any time of day.",
		"Guest30cht2": "They are especially good before and after a difficult battle!",
		"Guest30cht3": "Don't forget the crunchy mango as an added snack!",
		"Guest31cht1": "The sun is shining bright today.",
		"Guest31cht2": "I think I did a good job making it!",
		"Guest31cht3": "Ook ook!",
		"Guest32cht1": "This place is great and I am loving this dessert!",
		"Guest32cht2": "Yum!",
		"Guest33cht1": "This island is quite beautiful; I love the jolly atmosphere of this place.",
		"Guest33cht2": "I'd like to bring my family here someday.",
		"Guest34cht1": "I bought alot of food and sent it to my ogre friend back home.",
		"Guest34cht2": "I hope he enjoys it because now I don't have enough funds to get back...",
		"Guest35cht1": "Aww man!",
		"Guest35cht2": "This place is awesome!",
		"Guest35cht3": "I can't wait to bring my friends here one day!",
		"Guest36cht1": "Here's to finding yummier sweets!",
		"Guest37cht1": "In a tough spar with my cousin, Skylina, I threw an object into her beak when she opened it too wide.",
		"Guest37cht2": "Push come to shove, she blew up like a balloon.",
		"Guest37cht3": "Funny how that works...",
		"Guest38cht1": "Nothing beats a good poutine to go on an adventure!",
		"Guest38cht2": "It leaves enough room still to devour my opponents.",
		"Guest38cht3": "HAHAHA!",	
		"Guest39cht1": "Phew, I knew I should have packed summer clothes...",
		"Guest39cht2": "Recommend anything from the menu?",
		"Guest39cht3": "My shirt is getting a bit small...",
		"Guest3cht1": "This drink really hits the spot!",
		"Guest3cht2": "I wonder if I can take some to go...",
		"Guest40cht1": "Oof... I definitely can't fit any more food in me...",
		"Guest40cht2": "But I'm still kinda hungry... is that bad?",
		"Guest40cht3": "Is that bad?",
		"Guest41cht1": "(He seems to be playing cards against a fried turkey.)",
		"Guest41cht2": "(He has a pair of twos, and the turkey has a royal flush...)",
		"Guest42cht1": "Hmm... maybe I should get seconds...",
		"Guest42cht2": "Nothing wrong with large portions!",
		"Guest43cht1": "This is today's nourishment...",
		"Guest44cht1": "Hi, I'm a wanderer.",
		"Guest44cht2": "This island has lot nice places.",
		"Guest44cht3": "Have you explored it all?",
		"Guest45cht1": "I love the smell of freshly grilled fish and milk in the morning.",
		"Guest46cht1": "Y'know, it's nice to be up and at 'em, but remember to take breaks!",
		"Guest46cht2": "I for one think this spot is purrfect for that~",
		"Guest47cht1": "Man this meat looks absoluely delicious!",
		"Guest47cht2": "I wish I could eat it all day!",
		"Guest47cht3": "Though if I did, I might explode...",
		"Guest48cht1": "There's always so much to do and so little time...",
		"Guest48cht2": "Phew, sometimes a huge appetite can really work against you!",
		"Guest49cht1": "I have a friend that would love this place.",
		"Guest49cht2": "I can't wait to tell him about it!",
		"Guest4cht1": "Oh, that's a nice staff!",
		"Guest4cht2": "Thank you!",
		"Guest4cht3": "I'd let you borrow it for your quest, but I'm not sure you could handle its power.",
		"Guest4cht4": "Also, I'll literally die if I get seperated from it... So... You know...",	
		"Guest50cht1": "Slime may be my preference...",
		"Guest50cht2": "...but this 'rotisserie' stuff...",
		"Guest50cht3": "...it's not bad!",
		"Guest51cht1": "I want to get chubbier, but I don't gain weight no matter what I eat.",
		"Guest51cht2": "It would be great to be able to fill out my form more...",
		"Guest52cht1": "Mmm...",
		"Guest52cht2": "Meat always tastes better bone-in.",
		"Guest53cht1": "Gosh, I love the burritos here!",
		"Guest53cht2": "I could eat these every day!",
		"Guest54cht1": "Apple mare is best horse!",
		"Guest54cht2": "We'll have three stars someday...",
		"Guest54cht3": "Can't wait to celebrate the anniversary in October!",
		"Guest55cht1": "The service here is much friendlier than that grumpy bear restaurant... have you ever been there?",
		"Guest55cht2": "Do you eat here often? Anything you'd recommend?",
		"Guest55cht3": "Kinda amazed by how much there is on the menu here while yet still dishing out top quality food.",	
		"Guest56cht1": "This meat is delicious!",
		"Guest56cht2": "Do you want some?",
		"Guest57cht1": "It's my first time coming here, but I can definitely tell I'm gonna be making repeat visits!",
		"Guest57cht2": "Though I hope it doesn't ALL go to my thighs...",
		"Guest58cht1": "I don't want to face that many slimes ever again...",
		"Guest59cht1": "I'm Flint! Nice to meet you!",
		"Guest59cht2": "Man... the udon on this island is amazing!",
		"Guest60cht1": "All right now youngin' I got some words of advice for ya.",
		"Guest60cht2": "If your havin' trouble finding those mushrooms try looking in the walls!",
		"Guest60cht3": "Just follow the small ones to find the right wall, ya hear?",		
		"Guest5cht1": "Normally my diet consists of insects and ONLY insects...",
		"Guest5cht2": "But mushrooms that let you get huge? I'll gladly make an exception!",
		"Guest61cht1": "Hey! Nice to meetcha! Always good to meet new friends!",
		"Guest61cht2": "This island's food really packs on the pounds, wouldn't you agree?",
		"Guest61cht3": "If you've seen anything strange in your neighboring village, call me!",
		"Guest6cht1": "I'm traveling around the world to learn more about cooking! Right now I'm just resting though.",
		"Guest6cht2": "Adventurers need rest too! All I can do is sit at this restaurant though...",
		"Guest7cht1": "This is a nice island, but you should see MY island sometime.",
		"Guest8cht1": "Oh, hey, it's Munch!",
		"Guest8cht2": "When you're not saving the village, you should show me how to put away food like you do!",
		"Guest8cht3": "I'm so jealous!",
		"Guest9cht1": "Let's eat our food together, darling.",
		"Guest9cht2": "QUE RICOOOOO, don't you agree, fortachón?",
		"Koboldchat1": "C... come on! I'm not afraid!",
		"Koboldeaten1": "Hey, How do you do that?",
		"Koboldeaten2": "I feel like my weight become lighter after that happened...",
		"Koboldpassover1": "H... Hey, wait!",
		"RaccoonCrystal1": "At least there is plenty to study here.",
		"RaccoonCrystal2": "The presence of an avian shrine tells me that these caverns were occupied by the native islanders before.",
		"RaccoonCrystal3": "These crystals emanate a strange feeling...",
		"RaccoonCrystal4": "Like the beating heart of something massive!",
		"RaccoonCrystal5": "Is this island... alive?",
		"RaccoonForkBS1": "Your bodyslam power should prove useful ahead!",
		"RaccoonForkBS2": "I'm sure there are many things that need to be broken to proceed down below.",
		"RaccoonForkNoBS1": "I don't think this rock formation will budge without a hefty force.",
		"RaccoonGhost1": "So THESE are the remnants of the ancient civilization...",
		"RaccoonGhost2": "A friendly spirit here confirmed my suspicions about what happened.",
		"RaccoonGhost3": "That the bastion of power, the great tree, was felled to suppress the island's energy!",
		"RaccoonGhost4": "It appears that despite sealing the free-flowing of power, they were unsuccessful in sealing it all.",
		"RaccoonGhost5": "This extinction serves as a warning to those who oppose a power much greater than themselves, I suppose...",
		"RaccoonHiveKey1": "This island is full of surprises.",
		"RaccoonHiveKey2": "So many ancient artifacts. More to explore!",
		"RaccoonHiveNoKey1": "I'm really not sure about this particular gate.",
		"RaccoonHiveNoKey2": "Maybe someone in the village knows of its origin.",
		"RaccoonJungle1": "There's an old city to the east of here...",
		"RaccoonJungle2": "When you're trying to learn and understand the present, you must first understand the past!",
		"RaccoonJungle3": "What did this past civilization think about the magical land they lived on?",
		"RaccoonJungle4": "I have so many questions!",
		"RaccoonJungle5": "If only I didn't have to wade through all these plant things to get there...",
		"RaccoonMountain1": "It's so odd that a tree stump could function as a mountain!",
		"RaccoonMountain2": "The snow... FEELS like snow... but also has magical properties...",
		"RaccoonMountain3": "Could the tree's former power be dispersing, creating these snow and ice creatures?",
		"RaccoonMountain4": "I wish I could find out before I freeze my caboose off!",
		"RaccoonVillageFinal1": "I have one final realization surrounding this place.",
		"RaccoonVillageFinal2": "Listen closely...",
		"RaccoonVillageFinal3": "The spirit of this place is shattered into two!",
		"RaccoonVillageFinal4": "We can feel the threads of fate being pulled from both ends, especially now.",
		"RaccoonVillageFinal5": "One is stronger than the other, however...",
		"RaccoonVillageFinal6": "The spirit of light is desperately trying to hold the spirit of darkness back...",
		"RaccoonVillageFinal7": "I think with the right push... you can make the spirit of darkness back down!",
		"RaccoonVillageFinal8": "You are the rogue chess piece of balance, the island's trump card!",
		"RaccoonVillageFinal9": "The collective spirit awaits you both in trepidation and eagerness!",
		"RaccoonVillageFinal10": "As such, I put all my faith in you!",
