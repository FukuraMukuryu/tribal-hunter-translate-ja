		"TLdiagYCHredcatcave1": "What is a wanderer like you doing down here?",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatcave2": "Wandering... pretty much!",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatcave3": "Exploring, sightseeing, getting to meet new people...",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatcave4": "Maybe even new hobbies, like teasing the pigs here by jumping on em!",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatcave5": "I try my best not to hurt em, but I can't say they're all that nice either.",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatcave6": "I was about done with the caves anyways, might go exploring further!",

		"TLdiagYCHredcatchat8": "He gave me directions, but I think he got them all wrong...",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatchat9": "...Or maybe he intentionally lied to me?",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatenemies1": "Ya know, something has me curious.",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatenemies10": "I don't want the island exploding or something!",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatenemies11": "Right, sorry!",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatenemies12": "Don't ya worry... I'd rather help out than cause more trouble for ya.",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatenemies2": "A cat being curious?",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatenemies3": "Hah, ain't that true, but really...",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatenemies4": "I noticed that there are also cute slimes and some living crystals down here.",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatenemies5": "I already had a fair share of the slimes, but I'm curious about the crystals...",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatenemies6": "Wonder if they are powered up by mana!",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatenemies7": "Maybe I can take one home with me?",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatenemies8": "My friend might learn a thing or two...",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatenemies9": "Try not to cause too much trouble here, alright?",	
		"TLdiagYCHredcatwho1": "Who are you exactly?",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatwho10": "Yep!",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatwho11": "I'm actually on my way to find what's causing the island's troubles.",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatwho12": "Oh cool!",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatwho13": "Why don't I help you out with that then?",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatwho14": "I'll bestow on you a special incantation that may protect you from projectiles!",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatwho15": "It's only minor though... don't expect it to ever protect you against large blasts or anything!",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatwho16": "Hey, thanks!",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatwho2": "You don't appear to be one of the villagers.",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatwho3": "Me?",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatwho4": "I'm Keare Cryos, a sorceror!",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatwho5": "Well... kinda more of a cryomancer, but still!",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatwho6": "A bit of a 'do-gooder' as my friend puts it.",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatwho7": "But you...",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatwho8": "Heard about ya already when I first got here.",
		"TLdiagYCHredcatwho9": "You're the guardian for the villagers?",			
		"TLdiagcavegem1": "Oooh that's quite a magnificent looking diamond.",
		"TLdiagcavegem2": "This must be what that crocodile guy was looking for.",
		"TLdiagcavegem3": "Beach, here I come!",
		"TLdiagcavegem4": "It looks pretty valuable, I'm sure it's what the pigs were after.",
		"TLdiagcavegem5": "Guess I'll take it!",

		"TLdiagfoxmanapostfight8": "I think my capabilities have increased!",
		"TLdiagfoxmanapostfight9": "I wonder if I can upgrade more of my abilities now!",
		"TLdiagpigwarriorcaverns1": "Oh hello. Good to see you again.",
		"TLdiagpigwarriorcaverns10": "Alright then, wish me luck!",
		"TLdiagpigwarriorcaverns11": "Oh, just so you know.",
		"TLdiagpigwarriorcaverns12": "I saw one of your transportation statues along the southern path in the last tunnel.",
		"TLdiagpigwarriorcaverns13": "I don't know how birds get in here, but that must be there for a reason.",
		"TLdiagpigwarriorcaverns14": "Okay, thanks for the tip!",
		"TLdiagpigwarriorcaverns2": "Hey! What are you doing here?",
		"TLdiagpigwarriorcaverns3": "Now that Boarus has been defeated, I thought I could convince the mining unit to dial back its extraction.",
		"TLdiagpigwarriorcaverns4": "Seems they're just as greedy with or without a leader telling them to be.",
		"TLdiagpigwarriorcaverns5": "It's unfortunate.",
		"TLdiagpigwarriorcaverns6": "Looks like I'll have to convince them further with some bruises.",
		"TLdiagpigwarriorcaverns7": "I guess it's to be expected.",
		"TLdiagpigwarriorcaverns8": "They've been complacent for awhile with their behavior.",
		"TLdiagpigwarriorcaverns9": "You've been the only real wrench in their plans in a long time.",
		"TLdiagsaveddyegirl1": "Are you alright?",
		"TLdiagsaveddyegirl2": "Yeah.",
		"TLdiagsaveddyegirl3": "Thanks for taking care of those creatures.",
		"TLdiagsaveddyegirl4": "I did manage to extract the dye so I'm all set!",
		"TLdiagsaveddyegirl5": "Oh, good!",
		"TLdiagsaveddyegirl6": "If you want to change up your style, come see me at the village!",
		"TLdiagsaveddyegirl7": "These dyes I collect can be used to change your color design.",
		"TLdiagsaveddyegirl8": "I'll be sure to drop by sometime!",
		"TLdiagsavedhoodedcow1": "Don't worry, cow. you're safe now.",
		"TLdiagsavedhoodedcow2": "Your farmer is waiting for you back in the village.",
		"TLdiagsavedhoodedcow3": "Hurry back.",
