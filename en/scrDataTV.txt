		"tvepC10": "Quick, children... flee while I take care of this troublemaker.",
		"tvepC11": "Don't lose, okay Supercow?",
		"tvepC12": "Now to teach you a more permanent lesson.",
		"tvepC13": "Ha... I'm the strongest wolf in the Wolfen Clan!",
		"tvepC14": "I'll show you my strength!",
		"tvepC15": "HAAA!",
		"tvepC16": "Huff...",
		"tvepC17": "You are a tough one...",
		"tvepC18": "...Don't give up yet...!",
		"tvepC19": "...Use your inner power...!",
		"tvepC2": "Hey, it's the ice cream truck!",
		"tvepC20": "W...What?",
		"tvepC21": "Where is that voice coming from?",
		"tvepC22": "...I'm the spirit inside of you...!",
		"tvepC23": "...Turn your milk powers into strength...!",
		"tvepC24": "...You can do it... focus...!",
		"tvepC25": "H... how...?!",
		"tvepC26": "How are you getting so large?!",
		"tvepC27": "Haha, this is my true power!",
		"tvepC28": "NOOOOOOOooooooo...",
		"tvepC29": "Another day saved by Supercow!",
		"tvepC3": "Hooray! Icecream, icecream!",
		"tvepC30": "The mischievous Wolfen Clan won't give up it seems!",
		"tvepC31": "What will they try on the next episode of 'Mighty Flying Super Cow'?",
		"tvepC4": "Haha, one at a time young ones, I have plenty!",
		"tvepC5": "Ha, your disguise is terrible!",
		"tvepC6": "I see you wolves haven't given up yet.",
		"tvepC7": "Here to cause more trouble?",
		"tvepC8": "We have a score to settle with you, bovine!",
		"tvepC9": "So be it...",
		"tvepD1": "Near Holstain City, in the Wolfen Clan headquarters...",
		"tvepD10": "Send it all to our secret storage facility!",
		"tvepD11": "Ha ha ha!",
		"tvepD12": "A few days later, at the farm...",
		"tvepD13": "We need another order of cheese and milk!",
		"tvepD14": "But all my cows are completely drained...",
		"tvepD15": "I need more time to prepare that!",
		"tvepD16": "Ha ha, I knew it.",
		"tvepD17": "Look at you, all skinny and helpless without your precious dairy!",
		"tvepD18": "Arrgh...",
		"tvepD19": "I feel so weak... I'm totally drained...",
		"tvepD2": "What?",
		"tvepD20": "...Don't give up...!",
		"tvepD21": "...Find something to eat, it will recover your power...!",
		"tvepD22": "...Go to the Wolfen secret storage facility...!",
		"tvepD23": "...I can guide you there...!",
		"tvepD24": "And so Supercow snuck away and headed towards the Wolfen's unguarded facility!",
		"tvepD25": "It seems they have underestimated Supercow yet again!",
		"tvepD26": "Munch! Munch! Munch!",
		"tvepD27": "I can feel all my energy returning a hundred-fold!",
		"tvepD28": "The giant intake of food had pushed Supercow's limits farther than they had ever been before!",
		"tvepD29": "Will the Wolfen be able to handle this might?",
		"tvepD3": "You lost again?!",
		"tvepD30": "Later that day...",
		"tvepD31": "So, this is all the cows?",
		"tvepD32": "Let's take them all, guys!",
		"tvepD33": "Wait!",
		"tvepD34": "Stop, you thieves!",
		"tvepD35": "What?!",
		"tvepD36": "That Supercow is bigger than ever!",
		"tvepD37": "I thought we removed his power source!",
		"tvepD38": "You underestimate my power...",
		"tvepD39": "Your attempts to hide our recources from us failed!",
		"tvepD4": "I... I'm sorry!",
		"tvepD40": "Whaaa?!",
		"tvepD41": "Run guys!!!",
		"tvepD42": "Back at the Wolfen headquarters...",
		"tvepD43": "So you've failed miserably again, I see...",
		"tvepD44": "And now you come to seek my forgiveness... again...",
		"tvepD45": "I'm sorry... The plan didn't work on Supercow...",
		"tvepD46": "And now our credit card payments are huge from all the food purchases...",
		"tvepD47": "Argh... this isn't over, Supercow!",
		"tvepD48": "Another day saved by Supercow!",
		"tvepD49": "Will Dr. Sharptooth find a way to take Supercow down?",
		"tvepD5": "That Supercow is too strong... We're outmatched!",
		"tvepD50": "Find out on the next episode of 'Mighty Flying Super Cow'!",
		"tvepD6": "There must be a way to weaken that cow...",
		"tvepD7": "I heard that cow's power comes from its milk.",
		"tvepD8": "That gives me an idea!",
		"tvepD9": "Divert all the food sources away from the farm to malnourish them!",
		"tvepE1": "One day at the Wolfen clan headquarters...",
		"tvepE10": "Are you alright, though?",
		"tvepE11": "You look like you've gorged on way too many veggies...",
		"tvepE12": "Excuse me...",
		"tvepE13": "No worries captain!",
		"tvepE14": "I'll be able to produce a lot of top-quality milk!",
		"tvepE15": "That's what we expected... hehe.",
		"tvepE16": "You must be the boss of the Wolfen clan!",
		"tvepE17": "I'm going to end your even plan here!",
		"tvepE18": "Hehe, not so fast.",
		"tvepE19": "Guys! Now's the time!",
		"tvepE2": "So... Supercow can use its own milk as a power source, right?",
		"tvepE20": "Get Supercow!",
		"tvepE21": "What is that device?",
		"tvepE22": "This won't stop me!",
		"tvepE23": "Oh, it's simply to buy us some time.",
		"tvepE24": "Gotcha now, Supercow!",
		"tvepE25": "Take this!!!",
		"tvepE26": "Huh? What now?",
		"tvepE27": "A metal plate girdle...?",
		"tvepE28": "Yes... It covers your udder nicely, doesn't it?",
		"tvepE29": "Now the milk you produce will have nowhere to go!",
		"tvepE3": "Yes... but it can also produce milk infinitely, so we can't drain it!",
		"tvepE30": "Mua ha ha ha ha!",
		"tvepE31": "Supercow!",
		"tvepE32": "Your body is expanding!",
		"tvepE33": "Huff huff...",
		"tvepE34": "I... didn't expect this!",
		"tvepE35": "I can't get this girdle off!",
		"tvepE36": "Haha... look at you now...",
		"tvepE37": "A giant milk balloon!",
		"tvepE38": "Soon you'll pop and destroy this farm!",
		"tvepE39": "Mua ha ha ha ha!",
		"tvepE4": "Hmm... this gives me an idea...",
		"tvepE40": "I feel... too full...",
		"tvepE41": "Huff... huff...",
		"tvepE42": "Our hero is in great danger!",
		"tvepE43": "Can Supercow escape Dr. Sharptooth's trap and save the day?",
		"tvepE44": "Find out on the next episode of 'Mighty Flying Super Cow'!",
		"tvepE5": "If you can't drain it, think about it in reverse!",
		"tvepE6": "Infinite milk with nowhere to go!",
		"tvepE7": "Mua ha ha ha ha!",
		"tvepE8": "A few days later at the cow farm...",
		"tvepE9": "This year's harvest festival was a huge success!",
		"tvepF1": "Previously on 'Mighty Flying Super Cow'...",
		"tvepF10": "My belly got so big...",
		"tvepF11": "I feel like I'm going to burst...!",
		"tvepF12": "Gah!",
		"tvepF13": "I can't give this darned thing off you, Supercow!",
		"tvepF14": "...Don't give up...!",
		"tvepF15": "...You can withstand this...",
		"tvepF16": "...Hold this energy in...",
		"tvepF17": "Hmm...",
		"tvepF18": "Supercow is faring better than I expected...",
		"tvepF19": "Boss... it's the size of the whole barn!",
		"tvepF2": "Supercow fell into Dr. Sharptooth's trap...",
		"tvepF20": "Don't you think we should get away now...?",
		"tvepF21": "Maybe... but I want to see how this ends!",
		"tvepF22": "Hnnngh!",
		"tvepF23": "...I'm going to...!!!",
		"tvepF24": "Wha... the ground is shaking!",
		"tvepF25": "...This is your true inner potential...!",
		"tvepF26": "...I've never encountered a cow that could achieve this size before...!",
		"tvepF27": "Huaaaaaaa!!!",
		"tvepF28": "Game over, WOLFEN CLAN!",
		"tvepF29": "Supercow aimed his udder right at the Wolfen leader and his henchmen!",
		"tvepF3": "Unable to be milked, Supercow's milk energy surges inside...",
		"tvepF30": "Supercow has reached his peak power at last!",
		"tvepF31": "Uh oh...",
		"tvepF32": "This is baaaaaad!",
		"tvepF33": "WHY DONT YOU GUYS HAVE A NICE DRINK OF REFRESHING MILK!",
		"tvepF34": "IT'S GOOD FOR YOU!!!",
		"tvepF35": "T...this can't be...!",
		"tvepF36": "A little while later at the farm...",
		"tvepF37": "The police have arrived!",
		"tvepF38": "Where are the criminals?",
		"tvepF39": "There they are, full and immobile.",
		"tvepF4": "Hahaha, look at you!",
		"tvepF40": "Too much... milk...",
		"tvepF41": "You did it, Supercow!",
		"tvepF42": "Looks like I've discovered my true power.",
		"tvepF43": "I feel great!",
		"tvepF44": "Would you kindly bring me a milking machine?",
		"tvepF45": "Oh haha.",
		"tvepF46": "I forgot that you still have plenty of milk!",
		"tvepF47": "We're going to have a huge party tomorrow!",
		"tvepF48": "Sounds good!",
		"tvepF49": "I still stick around to protect the innocent and enact justice!",
		"tvepF5": "You spotted white water balloon!",
		"tvepF50": "With the evil Wolven clan dismantled and all the criminals in prison, this story is at its end!",
		"tvepF51": "What new adventures lie in wait for Supercow?",
		"tvepF52": "Only time will tell!",
		"tvepF53": "Thank you for watching 'Mighty Flying Super Cow'! Goodbye!",
		"tvepF6": "No... MILK balloon!",
		"tvepF7": "Mua ha ha ha ha!",
		"tvepF8": "Urrgh...",
		"tvepF9": "I... huff..."
