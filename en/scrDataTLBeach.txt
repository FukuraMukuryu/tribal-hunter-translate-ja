		"TLdiagYCHjackthree1": "What's this? Some sort of pirate hangout?",
		"TLdiagYCHjackthree2": "I never noticed this here before...",
		"TLdiagYCHjackthree3": "That would appear so, apparent non-pirate.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackthree4": "Are you interested in anything on the menu?",
		"TLdiagYCHjackfour1": "Hey, good to see you again.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackfour2": "What can I get ya?",
		"TLdiagYCHjackkillsha1": "Is Captain Killsha the leader of all the pirates here?",
		"TLdiagYCHjackkillsha2": "Yep, she runs that ragtag bunch.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackkillsha3": "That rowdy tomboy is as strong as she is beautiful.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackkillsha4": "I would advise against getting on her bad side.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackkillsha5": "Anyways, enough of all that heavy talk.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackkillsha6": "I'm sure you want a bite to eat, yeah?",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomers1": "I see you have some guests today...",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomers10": "I think the act of earning instead of taking would improve her character even more.",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomers11": "Do you really think the rest will leave now?",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomers12": "I'm sure they will. I don't think they're capable of finding as good of a leader.",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomers13": "Some of them left when she did, and I give them some credit for that.",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomers14": "Those who pacified themselves will likely be safe here on the island.",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomers15": "The rest, however, will get demolished by the pigs in no time without strong leadership.",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomers16": "I guess so...",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomers17": "Anyways, what about you?",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomers18": "Want something to eat?",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomers2": "Yeah... and get this... Someone challenged Killsha and beat her in a one-on-one fight!",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomers3": "It's hard to believe, I know.",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomers4": "I also didn't expect her crew to mutiny as a result.",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomers5": "It's like they have 'standards' all of the sudden.",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomers6": "I see... maybe she will be more receptive now that she's been humbled.",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomers7": "Yeah. She's not that bad once you get to know her.",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomers8": "She's been hanging out here until she figures out what shes going to do.",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomers9": "Heck. If those ragtags leave or splinter off, I might be able to resume normal business and offer her a job.",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomersegg1": "I see you have some guests today...",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomersegg2": "Yeah... That's... uhhh...",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomersegg3": "I'm still a bit surprised.",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomersegg4": "I knew Killsha was always a little on the chubby side, but she came here looking like that.",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomersegg5": "I have no clue what happened but she packed on a lot of pounds and her crew mutinied.",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomersegg6": "I see... maybe she will be more receptive now that she's been humbled.",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomersegg7": "Yeah. She's not that bad once you get to know her.",

		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomersegg16": "I guess so...",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomersegg17": "Honestly though...",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomersegg18": "Killsha... well...",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomersegg19": "She carries that weight quite nicely... ya know?",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomersegg20": "...",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomersegg21": "Anyways... well... uhh...",
		"TLdiagYCHjacknewcustomersegg22": "Want something to eat?",
		"TLdiagYCHjackone1": "Oh, hey.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackone10": "This used to be a prime spot for visitors and natives alike... at least until the pirates showed up.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackone11": "I can see how they would be bad for business...",
		"TLdiagYCHjackone12": "Eh... you'd think. However...",
		"TLdiagYCHjackone13": "You learn to deal with the cards you've been given.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackone14": "It's something I'm good at.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackone15": "When you're one of the only operating chefs on the island, you tend to have your market no matter what.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackone16": "These thugs have overflowing pockets, and almost nowhere to spend it.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackone17": "They leave me be because I'm the only luxury they'll ever have here.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackone18": "Tasty food cooked to perfection or raw piles of carrots?",
		"TLdiagYCHjackone19": "What do you think they choose?",
		"TLdiagYCHjackone2": "A customer that isn't a pirate.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackone3": "It's been awhile since I've had one of those.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackone4": "Does that mean you AREN'T a pirate?",
		"TLdiagYCHjackone5": "What, you thought all landwalker fish were pirates?",
		"TLdiagYCHjackone6": "Well, so far every fish I've met has been a pirate.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackone7": "...Fair point.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackone8": "Nope, I'm just Indigo Jack: proprieter of this food stall.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackone9": "Been making it work with my family's recipes for years.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackpirates1": "Making the pirates comfortable is hurting the island as a whole, you know.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackpirates10": "A pirate's life is far from an entrepreneur's one.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackpirates11": "Sure I'd be able to get closer to Captain Killsha, but I'd also get sloppy at my craft.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackpirates12": "A pirate's standards are in the gutter. I'd never improve my self-worth in the crew.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackpirates2": "*Sigh*...",
		"TLdiagYCHjackpirates3": "Look, man.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackpirates4": "I don't approve of what they do, but I'm just one shark.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackpirates5": "A scrawny one at that.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackpirates6": "I'm a cook, not a fighter.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackpirates7": "I have to look out for myself with what I know.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackpirates8": "I must be doing something right if I can turn down the requests to join their crew without repercussion.",
		"TLdiagYCHjackpirates9": "Why didn't you join them?",
		"TLdiagYCHjacktwo1": "Well, if it isn't my favorite - and only - non-pirate customer.",
		"TLdiagYCHjacktwo2": "What do ya need?",
		"TLdiagYCHplushdualA1": "I noticed that you both have tags on your tails... are you some kind of plush?",
		"TLdiagYCHplushdualA10": "But then it would be more difficult for you to grow and learn as a guardian.",
		"TLdiagYCHplushdualA11": "Besides, I'm on vacation. Haha!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushdualA12": "And I think I ate a bit too much... Haha!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushdualA13": "You need to stop eating so much or you'll get too big to move!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushdualA14": "Haha too big to move huh?",
		"TLdiagYCHplushdualA15": "Hey, come over here... I'll tell you a little secret!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushdualA2": "Oh haha, so you noticed that, well to be honest...",
		"TLdiagYCHplushdualA3": "We are actually guardians from our own islands.",
		"TLdiagYCHplushdualA4": "Yup. I left my island a few years ago after helping the people who summoned me to protect it.",
		"TLdiagYCHplushdualA5": "I left it to sample the food of the world!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushdualA6": "Same goes for me. That's how I met Kichi.",
		"TLdiagYCHplushdualA7": "He was behind the counter at a fancy restraunt helping them cook.",
		"TLdiagYCHplushdualA8": "It looked kinda difficult cause of that big belly of his. Haha!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushdualA9": "Being guardians ourselves normally we would offer to help you but...",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgrayA1": "Heyo, how's it going?",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgrayA10": "Well, so far, the pirates on the beach are not that kind...",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgrayA11": "I know.",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgrayA12": "People say I'm too nice to be a pirate... but to that I say:",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgrayA13": "'Who said all pirates have to be bad?' Haha!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgrayA14": "Hmm... I guess some pirates can be nice.",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgrayA2": "Hi!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgrayA3": "Are you vacationing here too?",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgrayA4": "Oh me?",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgrayA5": "I'm on vacation with my friend; He likes to travel a lot.",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgrayA6": "This is a really nice place, aside from the noise those pirates are making.",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgrayA7": "I once considered being a pirate myself!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgrayA8": "Even had a name for what my crew would be: the 'Button Nose Pirates'.",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgrayA9": "Get it? Because of my button-nose? Haha!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgrayB1": "Let me just boop that snoot...",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgrayB2": "What are you doing...",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgrayB3": "NO, WAIT!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgrayB4": "Haha, now who's too big to move!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgrayB5": "Uuurp... No fair!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgrayB6": "See I told you it had a very funny side effect! Tee hee!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgrayC1": "Haha, that never gets old!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgrayC2": "Uuurp... Darnit!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgrayD1": "Hardy har har!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgreenA1": "Hi there!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgreenA2": "Hey!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgreenA3": "What brings you to the island?",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgreenA4": "Well I'm a traveling gourmand and cook!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgreenA5": "I've been going from island to island trying out all sorts of new foods.",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgreenA6": "I'm learning as many recipies as I can so that one day I can open a restaurant of my own with exotic foods from all over the world under one roof.",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgreenA7": "This island in particular has some very unique delicacies I can't wait to try!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgreenA8": "That's nice! I want to try your food someday!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgreenB1": "He talks about being too big to move... well, you wanna see something funny?",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgreenB2": "As you can see he has an actual button for a nose...",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgreenB3": "Because of it, he can't smell... but it has a very funny side effect! Haha!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgreenB4": "Walk over to him and boop that button nose of his and watch what happens!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgreenC1": "Hehe, still enjoying the life eh?",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgreenC2": "Hopefully you can enjoy the freedom we have someday!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgreenD1": "Haha look at that puffball!",
		"TLdiagYCHplushgreenD2": "Good work!",
		"TLdiagYCHqunopostfight1": "Ughhh...",
		"TLdiagYCHqunopostfight2": "I feel so full...",
		"TLdiagYCHqunopostfight3": "Heh, how does it feel to taste your own medicine?",
		"TLdiagYCHqunopostfight4": "Well, actually it isnt that bad...",
		"TLdiagYCHqunopostfight5": "I'm basically a giant lazy pillow.",
		"TLdiagYCHqunopostfight6": "Ahh well, life comes at you fast huh...",
		"TLdiagYCHqunopostfight7": "Now if you'll excuse me, I have a captain to meet!",
		"TLdiagYCHqunopostfight8": "Sure... Whatever...",		
		"YCHqunochat1": "Uh hey... you again...",
		"YCHqunochat2": "Not going to shoot at me today?",
		"YCHqunochat3": "Eh... I'm taking a break from the cannonfire for now...",
		"YCHqunochat4": "You are pretty skilled at countering it though... so if you want a rematch let me know!",
		"YCHqunostory1": "You dont look fishy like the other pirates... How'd you end up here?",
		"YCHqunostory2": "Well, I came to this island to search for my big brother.",
		"YCHqunostory3": "You should meet him, he can get much larger than me!", 
		"YCHqunostory4": "Wow, that's interesting.",
		"YCHqunostory5": "I came to this beach and those pirates were good to me... so I just tried to help.",
		"YCHqunostory6": "They are actually PRETTY mean to other islanders.",
		"YCHqunostory7": "Well... I didn't know the details. I didn't mean to harm anyone.",
		"YCHqunobrother1": "So, found anything about your brother here?",
		"YCHqunobrother2": "Unfortunately, not yet. Maybe he's not on this island.",
		"YCHqunobrother3": "Wonder if he's looking for me, we're good brother and sister team.",
		"YCHqunobrother4": "I wish we could nap together like we used to...",
		"YCHqunobrother5": "Hope you find him soon.",
		"YCHqunobrother6": "Thanks.",
		"YCHqunorematch1": "Wanna have another shootout?",
		"QunoprefightEX1": "I won't lose this time!",
		"QunoprefightEX2": "We'll see about that, ye hardy!",
		"QunoprefightEX3": "Fire!!!",
		"QunoEXWon1": "I guess you bested me yet again...",
		"QunoEXWon2": "I'll have to improve my cannon strategy.",
		"QunoEXLost1": "Aha, couldn't defend against my cannon barrage!",
		"QunoEXLost2": "I'm sure you'll do better next time.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarmeet1": "Darn it... I can't believe that shark won't join the contest...",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarmeet10": "Unfortunately the person who normally hosts the contest isn't around this year due to the chaotic events that seem to be happening.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarmeet11": "I offered to host in their palce.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarmeet12": "I'm out in the field talent-scouting.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarmeet13": "Interesting... first I've heard of it.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarmeet14": "With all the danger though, I'm surprised the village is letting an outsider host their events.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarmeet15": "I may not be from this di- I mean island... but I can be very persuasive.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarmeet16": "I would hate for the contest to be cancelled over a silly little crisis.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarmeet17": "Speaking of which... Do you want to enter?",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarmeet18": "My talent scout didn't nab the contestant I wanted but I do have an open slot.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarmeet19": "Sure, sounds like fun!",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarmeet2": "She has such potential...",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarmeet20": "Great!",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarmeet21": "I'll head back to the village shortly and begin the preparations.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarmeet22": "Meet me there when you get the chance!",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarmeet3": "Oh!",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarmeet4": "Sorry...",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarmeet5": "I was just talking to myself.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarmeet6": "Hi, I'm Sugar.",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarmeet7": "And you are?",
		"TLdiagYCHsugarmeet8": "I'm Munch, the guardian of the village to the south.",

		"TLdiagbeachfirsttime1": "We have arrived.",
		"TLdiagbeachfirsttime2": "Welcome to the north beach.",
		"TLdiagbeachfirsttime3": "Population: A lot of pirates.",
		"TLdiagbeachfirsttime4": "This place looks pretty nice.",
		"TLdiagbeachfirsttime5": "And I wouldn't worry about the pirates much longer.",
		"TLdiagbeachfirsttime6": "Their time here is numbered.",
		"TLdiagbeachfirsttime7": "You're a confident one, aren't ya?",
		"TLdiagbeachfirsttime8": "Well, good luck.",
