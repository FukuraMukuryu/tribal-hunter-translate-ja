		"triggerYCHexplorercamp18": "I'm sure they will be happy to let you pick their brain about features and secrets hidden out in the wild!",
		"triggerYCHexplorercamp19": "Oh, well that sounds helpful.",

		"triggerYCHexplorercamp26": "Like with previous new recruits, we provide cool guild benefits.",
		"triggerYCHexplorercamp27": "We offer an explorer's uniform to brave the wilderness!",
		"triggerYCHexplorercamp28": "We also offer cartography services to better acquaint newcomers to the layout of the land.",

		"triggerYCHgambler5": "How could I lose 3 times in a row?!",
		"triggerYCHgambler6": "I told you!",
		"triggerYCHgambler7": "This game is rigged!",
		"triggerYCHgambler8": "Hey, don't blame an honest dealer for your bad luck!",
		"triggerYCHgambler9": "Grrr...",
		"triggerYCHmountainhealer1": "Hey, wait!",
		"triggerYCHmountainhealer10": "The archeologist that passed through here said it probably needs a magical artifact to be opened.",
		"triggerYCHmountainhealer11": "Oh, I see.",
		"triggerYCHmountainhealer12": "Thanks for the advice!",
		"triggerYCHmountainhealer13": "No problem.",
		"triggerYCHmountainhealer14": "By the way, if you're in the area and need a quick heal, I offer that to travelers free of charge!",

		"triggerYCHmountainhealer3": "Yeah.",
		"triggerYCHmountainhealer4": "Is there something up ahead?",
		"triggerYCHmountainhealer5": "Theres a very steep chasm up ahead.",
		"triggerYCHmountainhealer6": "I figured I'd let anyone passing through know for safety.",

		"triggerbirdmanencounter1": "~Burp~",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter10": "Now I get to kick my talons up and relax.",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter11": "These pigs even offered me a cushy retirement plan.",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter12": "All I can eat! No limits!",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter13": "Can't get a better deal than that!",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter14": "Errr.....",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter15": "I'm PRETTY sure they're just fattening you up to eat you...",

		"triggerbirdmanencounter2": "Oh...",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter20": "...Are you serious???",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter21": "These pigs are both menacing and manipulative.",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter22": "They've been slowly locking down the island's resources.",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter23": "They're partially responsible for the decline of the Village.",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter24": "Well... Shoot...",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter25": "I guess retirement will have to go back on hold.",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter26": "I better get back to work for the time being.",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter27": "Are you sure you can still fly...?",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter28": "That's a lot of extra flab you've acquired.",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter29": "You forget. I'M TO-RI, THE GREAT BIRDMAN!",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter3": "Are you the new errand boy?",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter30": "Here. Take one of my feathers.",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter31": "If you touch it to an avian statue like that one, it will call me to action!",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter32": "I can fly you to other active statues for a small fee.",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter33": "Simply passing by inactive ones will add them to your list of flight points!",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter34": "Well, I must be off! I have deliveries to make!",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter35": "Thanks again, and remember...",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter36": "THE GREAT BIRDMAN WILL ALWAYS HEED YOUR CALL!",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter37": "Wow...",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter38": "He CAN still fly...",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter39": "I should try this statue thing out!",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter4": "Please bring that fruit over here.",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter5": "I only serve the village.",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter6": "Who are you anyways?",
		"triggerbirdmanencounter7": "I'm To-Ri, the great birdman!",

		"triggerboarcave10": "Intruder at your 12 o'clock!",
		"triggerboarcave11": "Eh... I noticed.",
		"triggerboarcave12": "Hey punk!",
		"triggerboarcave13": "I've been watching you bust your way over here!",
		"triggerboarcave14": "Then you know why I'm here.",
		"triggerboarcave15": "I'll give you one chance to stop pillaging the village.",
		"triggerboarcave16": "Hah. A buzzy little fly thinks he can stop mah whole operashun.",
		"triggerboarcave17": "I'll tell ya what...",
		"triggerboarcave18": "If ya survive, I'll give ya a shot at me.",
		"triggerboarcave19": "'Cause right now, you hardly seem worth the effort.",
		"triggerboarcave2": "We have soooo much food now!",
		"triggerboarcave20": "Show this twerp some hospitality, will ya' boys?",
		"triggerboarcave21": "Sir!",
		"triggerboarcave3": "My mouth is salivating just thinking about it all...",
		"triggerboarcave4": "Darn straight!",
		"triggerboarcave5": "Gettin' stuff is easy if you just take it from someone else!",
		"triggerboarcave6": "We shoulda started doin' this a long time ago!",
		"triggerboarcave7": "Yeah. These dopey islanders should do a better job keeping their stuff.",
		"triggerboarcave8": "If you're weak, you deserve to have your stuff taken away!",
		"triggerboarcave9": "Hey Boss!",
		"triggerboarhoard1": "Ahh, the new champion!",
		"triggerboarhoard2": "Feast on whatever you wish here.",
		"triggerboarhoard3": "I would also recommend speaking with Boarus on your way out.",
		"triggerboarhoard4": "He seems to have been humbled a bit... he's at his throne back in the hideout.",
		"triggerfirstcow1": "Great job grabbing this beauty, guys.",
		"triggerfirstcow10": "Back off, gecko!",
		"triggerfirstcow11": "We've got no business with you.",
		"triggerfirstcow12": "Your evil deeds are over!",

		"triggerfirstcow14": "Don't make me laugh, twerp!",
		"triggerfirstcow15": "Get em' boys!!!",
		"triggerfirstcow2": "Did you see that dumb farmer's face?",
		"triggerfirstcow3": "He was nearly bawling his eyes out!",
		"triggerfirstcow4": "What nice folks, preparing such delicious food for us.",
		"triggerfirstcow5": "Hehe. We're going to have juicy steak tonight!",
		"triggerfirstcow6": "Sure will.",
		"triggerfirstcow7": "Let's wait for my friend to pick this up...",
		"triggerfirstcow8": "Halt!",
		"triggerfirstcow9": "Who goes there?",
		"triggerfirstcowmeet1": "Oh, that must be one of the village cows!",
		"triggerfirstcowmeet10": "Sheesh...",
		"triggerfirstcowmeet11": "Sorry, I'll just squeeze by you then.",
		"triggerfirstcowmeet12": "No can do...",
		"triggerfirstcowmeet13": "You look like good warm-up material!",
		"triggerfirstcowmeet14": "Put em up!",
		"triggerfirstcowmeet2": "Wow it sure is big...",
		"triggerfirstcowmeet3": "What's that all about, shrimp?",
		"triggerfirstcowmeet4": "Oh...",
		"triggerfirstcowmeet5": "I thought you might have been one of the farmer's...",
		"triggerfirstcowmeet6": "Farm!?",
		"triggerfirstcowmeet7": "HA!",
		"triggerfirstcowmeet8": "Do I look like a conformist consumerism machine?",
		"triggerfirstcowmeet9": "My job is to fracture skulls, and I'm damn good at it!",
		"triggerfirstkeymeet1": "Leave our land, runt.",
		"triggerfirstkeymeet10": "WAIT!",
		"triggerfirstkeymeet11": "WE'RE BEING FLAAAAANKED!",
		"triggerfirstkeymeet2": "Do it, or get pummeled.",
		"triggerfirstkeymeet3": "I have a PRETTY good feeling it isn't yours...",
		"triggerfirstkeymeet4": "Are you getting saucy with us?",
		"triggerfirstkeymeet5": "Look... I'm just trying to pass through.",
		"triggerfirstkeymeet6": "Now if you'll just-",
		"triggerfirstkeymeet7": "Enough warnings!",
		"triggerfirstkeymeet8": "GET HIM!",
		"triggerfirstkeymeet9": "Oh boy...",
		"triggerfoxholea1": "Intruder!",
		"triggerfoxholea10": "HE KILLED BIG BROTHER!",
		"triggerfoxholea11": "Murderer!",
		"triggerfoxholea12": "He doesn't look that tough...", 
		"triggerfoxholea13": "Brother probably just allowed him entry.",
		"triggerfoxholea14": "Not to brag, but I did infact beat him up twice.",
		"triggerfoxholea15": "Yeah right... Brother never loses.",
		"triggerfoxholea16": "Hmm... now that I think about it...",
		"triggerfoxholea17": "This must be that lizard that fights like a cow!",
		"triggerfoxholea18": "The one brother mentioned last time he was here.",
		"triggerfoxholea19": "You're able to grow just like brother, right?",
		"triggerfoxholea19A": "You're able to grow just like brother, right?",
		"triggerfoxholea2": "Intruuuuuder!!!",
		"triggerfoxholea20": "Yeah.",
		"triggerfoxholea21": "I was summoned by the village as it's guardian.",
		"triggerfoxholea22": "Ohhhhh!",
		"triggerfoxholea23": "Yeah that is you, isn't it!?",
		"triggerfoxholea23A": "Yeah! The lizard-whale-thing!",
		"triggerfoxholea24A": "Quite the... title.",
		"triggerfoxholea25A": "Brother can turn into a mobile trampoline.",

		"triggerfoxholea27A": "Come on bro, let's get him!",
		"triggerfoxholea28A": "Oh my gosh, YOU'RE RIGHT!",
		"triggerfoxholea29A": "GET HIMMMM!",
		"triggerfoxholea30A": "Darned kids....",
		"triggerfoxholea24": "Can you grow for us???",
		"triggerfoxholea25": "Errr... maybe later.",
		"triggerfoxholea26": "Heh... I bet you can't.",
		"triggerfoxholea27": "Brother can turn into a mobile trampoline.",
		"triggerfoxholea28": "I wonder if you can as well.",
		"triggerfoxholea29": "Get to the largest size you can and come back. We do really want to see!",
		"triggerfoxholea3": "What the... Who are you kids?",
		"triggerfoxholea4": "Look around you.",
		"triggerfoxholea5": "This is someone else's home, dummy.",
		"triggerfoxholea6": "I bet hes here to steal stuff!",
		"triggerfoxholea7": "Yeah... he has a villainous aura.",
		"triggerfoxholea8": "No, no, no. You have the wrong idea.",
		"triggerfoxholea9": "I got a key to this place from another fox.",
		"triggermushroomcat1": "Hello sir, you appear to be new around here!",
		"triggermushroomcat2": "Yeah, I was recently summoned here by the villagers.",
		"triggermushroomcat3": "Interesting... I hope your journey here ends up being fruitful.",
		"triggermushroomcat4": "Here's a special tip from me to you...",
		"triggermushroomcat5": "Keep an eye out for mushrooms!",
		"triggermushroomcat6": "See that small one behind you? That means a larger one is nearby!",
		"triggermushroomcat7": "Looks like there's one hidden there in that ledge.",
		"triggermushroomcat8": "I've heard they can empower enchanted folks like you!",
		"triggermushroomcat9": "Ahh, good to know!",
		"triggerpigwarrior1": "Hmm... You're a fresh face...",
		"triggerpigwarrior10": "Huh... ",
		"triggerpigwarrior11": "I never really thought about that.",
		"triggerpigwarrior12": "Maybe I can help both the village and the pigs!",
		"triggerpigwarrior13": "Maybe you can.",
		"triggerpigwarrior14": "If you want to challenge him, go find him in his hideout.",
		"triggerpigwarrior15": "If you go to the end of the Hideout to the east, you'll find him eventually.",
		"triggerpigwarrior16": "Why haven't you challenged him if you dislike him so much?",
		"triggerpigwarrior17": "Eh...",
		"triggerpigwarrior18": "I kind of owe him.",
		"triggerpigwarrior19": "He taught me what strength is.",
		"triggerpigwarrior2": "What brings you this far into pig territory?",
		"triggerpigwarrior20": "While it may have gone to his head, he's done some good in his past.",
		"triggerpigwarrior21": "I see.",
		"triggerpigwarrior22": "Well, I'll see if I can knock some sense into him.",
		"triggerpigwarrior23": "Good luck.",
		"triggerpigwarrior3": "I'm putting a stop to pigs like you pillaging my village!",
		"triggerpigwarrior4": "I see... Well you won't have to worry about me...",
		"triggerpigwarrior5": "Plus, I can already tell your worth judging by your successful infiltration into the hideout.",
		"triggerpigwarrior6": "So... you don't care that I'm punching my way through your land?",
		"triggerpigwarrior7": "Eh... It's all just politics.",
		"triggerpigwarrior8": "Not all pigs agree with Boarus' ideas of domination.",
		"triggerpigwarrior9": "Some would probably prefer if you roughed him up a bit.",
		"triggerraccooncaveent1": "Ahh!",
		"triggerraccooncaveent10": "They don't know the true educational value of such a discovery!",
		"triggerraccooncaveent11": "I could try to thin them out so you can get back to your work--",
		"triggerraccooncaveent12": "Wait...",
		"triggerraccooncaveent13": "That looks pretty blocked off.",
		"triggerraccooncaveent14": "Yeah... A big fat pig barricaded this entrance to keep intruders out.",
		"triggerraccooncaveent15": "It looks like you would need to produce huge impact to break this wall free.",
		"triggerraccooncaveent16": "Hmm...",
		"triggerraccooncaveent17": "I'm sure I can figure it out. I'll come back later.",
		"triggerraccooncaveent2": "You startled me, lizard-man!",
		"triggerraccooncaveent3": "Am I really that scary?",
		"triggerraccooncaveent4": "Oh...",
		"triggerraccooncaveent5": "Uhh...",
		"triggerraccooncaveent6": "No, I'm just a little on-edge...",
		"triggerraccooncaveent7": "Is something wrong?",
		"triggerraccooncaveent8": "I was trying to study the caves down below, but I got kicked out by the pigs.",
		"triggerraccooncaveent9": "They're trying to claim the hoard of precious energy crystals rumored to be growing somewhere down there.",
		"triggerrestrauntownerrescue1": "I've told you countless times, granny!",
		"triggerrestrauntownerrescue10": "Anything she cooks is probably better than your meals, Terrence.",
		"triggerrestrauntownerrescue11": "All you do is boil everything and you don't season anything...",
		"triggerrestrauntownerrescue12": "Shut up!!!",
		"triggerrestrauntownerrescue13": "Salt is bad for you!",
		"triggerrestrauntownerrescue14": "I can cook better than this wannabe.",
		"triggerrestrauntownerrescue15": "Let's show her some of the ol' spicy pork!",
		"triggerrestrauntownerrescue16": "That's enough!",
		"triggerrestrauntownerrescue17": "If you want her, you'll have to go through me!",
		"triggerrestrauntownerrescue18": "Doesn't anybody respect our 'NO TRESSPASSING' signs!?",
		"triggerrestrauntownerrescue19": "Screw it.",
		"triggerrestrauntownerrescue2": "This is our territory!",
		"triggerrestrauntownerrescue20": "Let's just eliminate them!",
		"triggerrestrauntownerrescue3": "I'll hunt wherever I please.",
		"triggerrestrauntownerrescue4": "Nature belongs to no one.",
		"triggerrestrauntownerrescue5": "I'd hunt you sacks of meat if my joints weren't acting up.",
		"triggerrestrauntownerrescue6": "I recognize this saggy lady...",
		"triggerrestrauntownerrescue7": "She's a well known chef of the island tribe.",
		"triggerrestrauntownerrescue8": "We could kidnap her and make her cook for us!",
		"triggerrestrauntownerrescue9": "Great idea! We could use a new chef.",
		"triggertorimeetfinal1": "Woah! You are back!",
		"triggertorimeetfinal2": "I guess I should have trusted Yisya all along!",
		"triggertorimeetfinal3": "Never count us out!",
		"triggertorimeetfinal4": "I need you to take me back up the mountain right away!",
		"triggertorimeetfinal5": "You want to go back!?",
		"triggertorimeetfinal6": "I think the island can still be saved.",
		"triggertorimeetfinal7": "I can feel the spirit waiting for me to confront her.",
		"triggertorimeetfinal8": "Well, I guess you have all of our support then!",
		"triggertorimeetfinal9": "Let me know when you're ready to go!",
		"triggerwhitespiritPL1": "Hmm... so you are the one...",
		"triggerwhitespiritPL2": "What the...",
		"triggerwhitespiritPL3": "Oh, don't mind me, guardian.",
		"triggerwhitespiritPL4": "I simply wanted to observe you for the first time.",
		"triggerwhitespiritPL5": "Hmm... You will do...",
		"triggerwhitespiritPL6": "Keep pressing on, and pay this interaction no mind.",
