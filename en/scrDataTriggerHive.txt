		"triggerbeebouncer2": "Whoa, you're huge!",
		"triggerbeebouncer3": "Wait... you're not a drone!",
		"triggerbeebouncer4": "Don't hurt me!",
		"triggerbeebouncer5": "All I do is store honey!",
		"triggerbeebouncer6": "I won't, but I need to get through this hive.",
		"triggerbeebouncer7": "Any idea how to get through these vertical tunnels?",
		"triggerbeebouncer8": "They're too wide to jump up.",
		"triggerbeebouncer9": "Ohh... Ermmm...",
		"triggerbeebouncer10": "If you can't fly I guess you would need a trampoline or something...",
		"triggerbeebouncer11": "Hmm... You don't say...",
		"triggerbeethroneroom1": "Halt!",
		"triggerbeethroneroom2": "Invader!",
		"triggerbeethroneroom3": "Vacate the entrance to the Queen's chamber!",
		"triggerbeethroneroom4": "Failure to comply will result in a nasty sting!",
		"triggerbeethroneroom5": "He doesn't look that menacing.",
		"triggerbeethroneroom6": "I'm just passing through to the mountain.",
		"triggerbeethroneroom7": "Then this is not the path for you.",
		"triggerbeethroneroom8": "Turn back and go up...",
		"triggerbeethroneroom9": "Wait...",
		"triggerbeethroneroom10": "He's the one that's been ravaging our honey reserves!",
		"triggerbeethroneroom11": "Is that so?",
		"triggerbeethroneroom12": "Then Her Eminence will give us a sizable reward for his capture!",
		"triggerbeethroneroom13": "Get him!",
		"triggerfoxhivea1": "Hey!",
		"triggerfoxhivea2": "It's you again!",
		"triggerfoxhivea3": "What are you doing here?",
		"triggerfoxhivea4": "Huh...",
		"triggerfoxhivea5": "I didn't expect you to get here specifically...",
		"triggerfoxhivea6": "Mountain, right?",
		"triggerfoxhivea7": "Uhh...Yeah...?",
		"triggerfoxhivea8": "Then head on up!",
		"triggerfoxhivea9": "Go on, up you go!",
		"triggerfoxhivea10": "What about that path behind you?",
		"triggerfoxhivea11": "I... Uhh...",
		"triggerfoxhivea12": "Nah, there's nothing over there.",
		"triggerfoxhivea13": "Just a dead end.",
		"triggerfoxhivea14": "Now head on up, I gotta hit the road.",
		"triggerfoxhivea15": "Hmm... weird...",
		"triggerfoxhivea16": "Hey, what's that?",
		"triggerfoxhivea17": "It's a key with a leaf ornament...",
		"triggerfoxhivea18": "I wonder what this opens...",
		"triggerhivegate1": "Oh hey, how goes the exploration?",
		"triggerhivegate2": "Oh... pretty good.",
		"triggerhivegate3": "I can't seem to breach this strange ancient gate, though.",
		"triggerhivegate4": "Do you think it can be shattered?",
		"triggerhivegate5": "I have to pass through here to reach the mountain's peak.",
		"triggerhivegate6": "Not likely... It appears to need a particular keystone.",
		"triggerhivegate7": "The keystones mimic electromagnetic switches, but with a different kind of energy.",
		"triggerhivegate8": "Judging by its age, I'm sure someone in the village might know of its origins.",
		"triggerhivegate9": "Alright, I'll figure it out.",
		"triggeropenhivegate1": "Ahh, here's the ancient gate.",
		"triggeropenhivegate2": "Looks like the keystone fits into the slot.",
		"triggeropenhivegate3": "Most impressive.",
		"triggeroutsidehive1": "Make sure to keep your guard up.",
		"triggeroutsidehive2": "Those are some tough cookies up ahead.",
		"triggeroutsidehive3": "It would be a disaster if they got into the hive...",
		"triggeroutsidehive4": "What's that about tough cookies?",
		"triggeroutsidehive5": "Where'd you come from!?",
		"triggeroutsidehive6": "Get him!!!",
		"triggerYCHgreendude1": "Hmmm...",
		"triggerYCHgreendude2": "Hey, something wrong?",
		"triggerYCHgreendude3": "Oh, hello. I heard there's a big hive in the mountain, so I've come here to find out if I can do some beekeeping here.",
		"triggerYCHgreendude4": "However, it seems like there's already some kind of symbiosis system is built in.",
		"triggerYCHgreendude5": "Oh, really? Well, I was looking for path to climb up the mountain...",
		"triggerYCHgreendude6": "You should go through these caverns then.",
		"triggerYCHgreendude7": "Just be careful with bees, somehow they can use honey as a weapon!",
		"triggerYCHgreendude8": "Ok, thanks for the advice!",
		"triggerYCHsqueaks1": "Hey!",
		"triggerYCHsqueaks10": "I might just sit on YOU!",
		"triggerYCHsqueaks11": "Fine, we'll have a good 'ol rough and tumble then!",
		"triggerYCHsqueaks12": "But when I beat you, you're getting squashed!",
		"triggerYCHsqueaks2": "Who the heck?",
		"triggerYCHsqueaks3": "How'd you find this place!?",
		"triggerYCHsqueaks4": "I was just wanderi-",
		"triggerYCHsqueaks5": "Wait.",
		"triggerYCHsqueaks6": "It doesn't matter.",
		"triggerYCHsqueaks7": "Everything here is MINE and now that includes you too!",
		"triggerYCHsqueaks8": "Let's get you sat on, RUNT!",
		"triggerYCHsqueaks9": "If you really want to fight then let's go, then...",
		"triggersacredcow1": "This beast contains great energy...",
		"triggersacredcow2": "Her highness will be pleased.",
		"triggersacredcow3": "Do you think it produces nectar?",
		"triggersacredcow4": "That is unlikely.",
		"triggersacredcow5": "Hey, buzz off!",
		"triggersacredcow6": "That cow is returning to the village with me.",
		"triggersacredcow7": "That is also quite unlikely.",
		"triggersacredcow8": "It appears we have gained another offering.",
		"triggersacredcow9": "Engage!",
