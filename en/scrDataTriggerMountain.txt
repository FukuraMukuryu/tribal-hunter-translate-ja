		"triggerYCHtigercat11": "Or was it making the mistake of thinking that whoever owned this castle would be willing to help us?",
		"triggerYCHtigercat12": "And instead, we end up getting chased about until we found this secret abode and had to hide like a pair of stowaways?",
		"triggerYCHtigercat13": "What part of that whole miserable experience wasn't so bloody bad?!",
		"triggerYCHtigercat14": "Despite everything, I still have you.",

		"triggerYCHtigercat4": "Oh, and what, pray tell, makes you say that?",
		"triggerYCHtigercat5": "Was it the part where the village we were staying at got raided?",
		"triggerYCHtigercat6": "Was it being trapped in a mine and having to crawl on all fours through a secret tunnel we found?",
		"triggerYCHtigercat7": "And once we finally got out, we were almost skewered by pirates?",
		"triggerYCHtigercat8": "How about being harassed by ghosts in a haunted forest?",
		"triggerYCHtigercat9": "And fleeing for our lives from territorial bees the size of people?",
		"triggerbountyhunter1": "(This doesn't look good...)",
		"triggerbountyhunter10": "Who asked you, ya' masked weirdo!",
		"triggerbountyhunter11": "Darkdread told us to trap his spirit into a bottle!",
		"triggerbountyhunter12": "We ain't stupid!",
		"triggerbountyhunter13": "Our odds may improve if we worked together instead of squabbling amongst ourselves.",

		"triggerbountyhunter15": "No thanks.",
		"triggerbountyhunter16": "(Commissioning bounty hunters to get rid of me?)",
		"triggerbountyhunter17": "(I guess Darkdread isn't as confident as I thought...)",
		"triggerbountyhunter18": "Huh...",
		"triggerbountyhunter19": "Hmmmmm...",
		"triggerbountyhunter2": "(What are these guys up to?)",
		"triggerbountyhunter20": "Say Garry... you read over the bounty post on that lizard right?",
		"triggerbountyhunter21": "What did he look like again?",
		"triggerbountyhunter22": "Do I have to explain it all again?",
		"triggerbountyhunter23": "He's a reptilian with a surprising amount of hair, wears a ridiculous hoodie, and-",
		"triggerbountyhunter24": "Hey my hoodie looks WAY better then what you're wearing, punk!",
		"triggerbountyhunter25": "It's Munch!!!",
		"triggerbountyhunter26": "Every hunter for themselves!",
		"triggerbountyhunter3": "Stop embarrassing yourself pork chop.",
		"triggerbountyhunter4": "That bounty is good as mine!",
		"triggerbountyhunter5": "You won't get the chance to collect after I've blown that lizard to smithereens!",
		"triggerbountyhunter6": "I'll send his remains to Darkdread myself!",
		"triggerbountyhunter7": "No good.",
		"triggerbountyhunter8": "Munch's spirit enters a new body when defeated.",
		"triggerbountyhunter9": "Capturing would be better.",
		"triggerdragonduel1": "Ahh. It is the toy that Darkdread speaks of.",
		"triggerdragonduel2": "Then you know why I'm here.",
		"triggerdragonduel3": "Quite.",
		"triggerdragonduel4": "I must commend you for even making it this far.",
		"triggerdragonduel5": "However... I will have to halt you here...",

		"triggermeetshifu1": "Hello!",
		"triggermeetshifu10": "I'm just a humble creature living in this cave.",

		"triggermeetshifu13": "Has his influence not reached you?",
		"triggermeetshifu14": "I'm aware of him... of course...",
		"triggermeetshifu15": "Noble of you to take up such a large task.",
		"triggermeetshifu16": "In fact, I'm sure I could provide you with some assistance...",
		"triggermeetshifu17": "Oh... really?",
		"triggermeetshifu18": "You are an avatar of a guardian spirit.",
		"triggermeetshifu19": "Your abilities are already apparent to me, as I have seen them before.",
		"triggermeetshifu2": "......",
		"triggermeetshifu20": "In fact... I can perform such feats myself.",
		"triggermeetshifu21": "Let's just say that my powers are more... honed though.",
		"triggermeetshifu22": "If you can contain a capacity of at least 950, then you are ready for my special training.",
		"triggermeetshifu23": "I believe I have achieved this already!",
		"triggermeetshifu24": "That is also apparent.",
		"triggermeetshifu25": "Please speak to me when you are ready, then.",
		"triggermeetshifuA23": "Oh, I see... Then I'll return once I've met your requirement.",
		"triggermeetshifuA24": "I have faith that you will.",
		"triggermeetshifuA25": "Reach that benchmark and we will resume our conversation.",
		"triggermeetshifu3": "What is this place?",
		"triggermeetshifu4": "...I'm meditating...",
		"triggermeetshifu5": "Oh, sorry to interrupt.",
		"triggermeetshifu6": "*Sigh* It's alright.",
		"triggermeetshifu7": "I sensed your presence the second you entered the mountains.",
		"triggermeetshifu8": "Am I really that noticeable?",
		"triggermeetshifu9": "Just who are you, anyways?",
		"triggermountaincave1": "There you are!",
		"triggermountaincave10": "Took a lot longer than I thought though...",
		"triggermountaincave11": "Oh, you didn't have to do that for me!",
		"triggermountaincave12": "Thank you, I really appreciate it.",
		"triggermountaincave13": "Let's go call for To-ri to take you back.",
		"triggermountaincave14": "Hmm... it might be too dangerous to fly in this weather...",
		"triggermountaincave15": "I think we should wait here.",
		"triggermountaincave16": "Oh, alright.",
		"triggermountaincave2": "Are you okay?",
		"triggermountaincave3": "Oh, it's you!",
		"triggermountaincave4": "Sorry I'm so late on returning!",
		"triggermountaincave5": "To-ri must be worried about me...",
		"triggermountaincave6": "What are you guys doing here anyways?",
		"triggermountaincave7": "It's dangerous!",
		"triggermountaincave8": "I heard you were looking for these.",
		"triggermountaincave9": "I looked all over and was able to find some!",
		"triggertorimountwarn1": "Hey, Munch!",
		"triggertorimountwarn10": "I'm sure she found a suitable shelter somewhere.",
		"triggertorimountwarn11": "I guess so...",
		"triggertorimountwarn12": "I'm sure I'll run into her at some point.",
		"triggertorimountwarn13": "You will; I'm sure of it.",
		"triggertorimountwarn14": "I'll keep looking from above.",
		"triggertorimountwarn15": "Farewell!",
		"triggertorimountwarn2": "Oh, hey!",
		"triggertorimountwarn3": "What are you doing up here?",
		"triggertorimountwarn4": "Err... have you seen Yisya around here?",
		"triggertorimountwarn5": "She asked me to bring her to the mountain...",
		"triggertorimountwarn6": "She said she would find her way back to me but I haven't seen her!",
		"triggertorimountwarn7": "What!?",
		"triggertorimountwarn8": "She can't handle herself up here!",
		"triggertorimountwarn9": "Well, she's tougher than she looks.",
		"triggerwinterhammerpigcave1": "YOU DIRTY LIZARD!",
		"triggerwinterhammerpigcave2": "THE WOLVES WILL FIND US FOR SURE NOW!",
		"triggerwhitespiritmountain1": "You are almost there... The castle awaits...",
		"triggerwhitespiritmountain2": "Where your destiny leads...",
		"triggerwhitespiritmountain3": "Destiny this, destiny that, are you ever going to be specific?",
		"triggerwhitespiritmountain4": "You will know when the time arives...",
