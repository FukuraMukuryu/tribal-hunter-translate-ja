		"Guest4cht2": "Thank you!",
		"Guest4cht3": "I'd let you borrow it for your quest, but I'm not sure you could handle its power.",

		"Guest54cht2": "We'll have three stars someday...",
		"Guest54cht3": "Can't wait to celebrate the anniversary in October!",
		"Guest55cht1": "The service here is much friendlier than that grumpy bear restaurant... have you ever been there?",
		"Guest55cht2": "Do you eat here often? Anything you'd recommend?",
		"Guest55cht3": "Kinda amazed by how much there is on the menu here while yet still dishing out top quality food.",	
		"Guest56cht1": "This meat is delicious!",
		"Guest56cht2": "Do you want some?",
		"Guest57cht1": "It's my first time coming here, but I can definitely tell I'm gonna be making repeat visits!",

		"Guest60cht3": "Just follow the small ones to find the right wall, ya hear?",		
		"Guest5cht1": "Normally my diet consists of insects and ONLY insects...",
		"Guest5cht2": "But mushrooms that let you get huge? I'll gladly make an exception!",
		"Guest61cht1": "Hey! Nice to meetcha! Always good to meet new friends!",
		"Guest61cht2": "This island's food really packs on the pounds, wouldn't you agree?",
		"Guest61cht3": "If you've seen anything strange in your neighboring village, call me!",
		"Guest6cht1": "I'm traveling around the world to learn more about cooking! Right now I'm just resting though.",
		"Guest6cht2": "Adventurers need rest too! All I can do is sit at this restaurant though...",
		"Guest7cht1": "This is a nice island, but you should see MY island sometime.",
		"Guest8cht1": "Oh, hey, it's Munch!",
		"Guest8cht2": "When you're not saving the village, you should show me how to put away food like you do!",
