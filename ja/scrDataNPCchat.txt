		"Guest26cht2": "I can barely put away one plate...!",
		"Guest27cht1": "I just thought of a great souvenir for this place!",
		"Guest27cht2": "A doll based off of the Island Guardian!",
		"Guest27cht3": "What's with that look?",
		"Guest27cht4": "Wouldn't you like one?",
		"Guest28cht1": "Normally, I prefer to not indulge in dishes with garlic...",
		"Guest28cht2": "But lately, I can't get enough of it!",
		"Guest29cht1": "Heya! Try the food, it's fantastic!",
		"Guest29cht2": "And you can't adventure on an empty stomach.",

		"Guest35cht3": "I can't wait to bring my friends here one day!",
		"Guest36cht1": "Here's to finding yummier sweets!",
		"Guest37cht1": "In a tough spar with my cousin, Skylina, I threw an object into her beak when she opened it too wide.",
		"Guest37cht2": "Push come to shove, she blew up like a balloon.",
		"Guest37cht3": "Funny how that works...",
		"Guest38cht1": "Nothing beats a good poutine to go on an adventure!",
		"Guest38cht2": "It leaves enough room still to devour my opponents.",
		"Guest38cht3": "HAHAHA!",	
		"Guest39cht1": "Phew, I knew I should have packed summer clothes...",
		"Guest39cht2": "Recommend anything from the menu?",
		"Guest39cht3": "My shirt is getting a bit small...",
		"Guest3cht1": "This drink really hits the spot!",
		"Guest3cht2": "I wonder if I can take some to go...",
		"Guest40cht1": "Oof... I definitely can't fit any more food in me...",
		"Guest40cht2": "But I'm still kinda hungry... is that bad?",
		"Guest40cht3": "Is that bad?",
		"Guest41cht1": "(He seems to be playing cards against a fried turkey.)",
		"Guest41cht2": "(He has a pair of twos, and the turkey has a royal flush...)",
		"Guest42cht1": "Hmm... maybe I should get seconds...",
		"Guest42cht2": "Nothing wrong with large portions!",
		"Guest43cht1": "This is today's nourishment...",
		"Guest44cht1": "Hi, I'm a wanderer.",
		"Guest44cht2": "This island has lot nice places.",
		"Guest44cht3": "Have you explored it all?",
		"Guest45cht1": "I love the smell of freshly grilled fish and milk in the morning.",
		"Guest46cht1": "Y'know, it's nice to be up and at 'em, but remember to take breaks!",
		"Guest46cht2": "I for one think this spot is purrfect for that~",
		"Guest47cht1": "Man this meat looks absoluely delicious!",
		"Guest47cht2": "I wish I could eat it all day!",
		"Guest47cht3": "Though if I did, I might explode...",
		"Guest48cht1": "There's always so much to do and so little time...",
		"Guest48cht2": "Phew, sometimes a huge appetite can really work against you!",
		"Guest49cht1": "I have a friend that would love this place.",
		"Guest49cht2": "I can't wait to tell him about it!",
		"Guest4cht1": "Oh, that's a nice staff!",
		"Guest4cht2": "Thank you!",
		"Guest4cht3": "I'd let you borrow it for your quest, but I'm not sure you could handle its power.",
		"Guest4cht4": "Also, I'll literally die if I get seperated from it... So... You know...",	
		"Guest50cht1": "Slime may be my preference...",
		"Guest50cht2": "...but this 'rotisserie' stuff...",
		"Guest50cht3": "...it's not bad!",
		"Guest51cht1": "I want to get chubbier, but I don't gain weight no matter what I eat.",
		"Guest51cht2": "It would be great to be able to fill out my form more...",
		"Guest52cht1": "Mmm...",
		"Guest52cht2": "Meat always tastes better bone-in.",
		"Guest53cht1": "Gosh, I love the burritos here!",
		"Guest53cht2": "I could eat these every day!",
		"Guest54cht1": "Apple mare is best horse!",
		"Guest54cht2": "We'll have three stars someday...",
		"Guest54cht3": "Can't wait to celebrate the anniversary in October!",
		"Guest55cht1": "The service here is much friendlier than that grumpy bear restaurant... have you ever been there?",
		"Guest55cht2": "Do you eat here often? Anything you'd recommend?",
		"Guest55cht3": "Kinda amazed by how much there is on the menu here while yet still dishing out top quality food.",	
		"Guest56cht1": "This meat is delicious!",
		"Guest56cht2": "Do you want some?",
		"Guest57cht1": "It's my first time coming here, but I can definitely tell I'm gonna be making repeat visits!",
		"Guest57cht2": "Though I hope it doesn't ALL go to my thighs...",
		"Guest58cht1": "I don't want to face that many slimes ever again...",
		"Guest59cht1": "I'm Flint! Nice to meet you!",
		"Guest59cht2": "Man... the udon on this island is amazing!",
		"Guest60cht1": "All right now youngin' I got some words of advice for ya.",
		"Guest60cht2": "If your havin' trouble finding those mushrooms try looking in the walls!",
		"Guest60cht3": "Just follow the small ones to find the right wall, ya hear?",		
		"Guest5cht1": "Normally my diet consists of insects and ONLY insects...",
		"Guest5cht2": "But mushrooms that let you get huge? I'll gladly make an exception!",
		"Guest61cht1": "Hey! Nice to meetcha! Always good to meet new friends!",
		"Guest61cht2": "This island's food really packs on the pounds, wouldn't you agree?",
		"Guest61cht3": "If you've seen anything strange in your neighboring village, call me!",
		"Guest6cht1": "I'm traveling around the world to learn more about cooking! Right now I'm just resting though.",
		"Guest6cht2": "Adventurers need rest too! All I can do is sit at this restaurant though...",
		"Guest7cht1": "This is a nice island, but you should see MY island sometime.",
		"Guest8cht1": "Oh, hey, it's Munch!",
		"Guest8cht2": "When you're not saving the village, you should show me how to put away food like you do!",
		"Guest8cht3": "I'm so jealous!",
		"Guest9cht1": "Let's eat our food together, darling.",
		"Guest9cht2": "QUE RICOOOOO, don't you agree, fortachón?",
		"Koboldchat1": "C... come on! I'm not afraid!",
		"Koboldeaten1": "Hey, How do you do that?",
		"Koboldeaten2": "I feel like my weight become lighter after that happened...",
		"Koboldpassover1": "H... Hey, wait!",
		"RaccoonCrystal1": "少なくとも　ここには研究すべきことが　たくさんあるんだな",
		"RaccoonCrystal2": "ほこらがあるって事は　この洞窟には島の先住民が　住んでいたってことだな",
		"RaccoonCrystal3": "このクリスタルは　なんとも不思議なもので･･･",
		"RaccoonCrystal4": "まるで　巨大な心臓の鼓動のようなものを　感じるんだな！",

		"RaccoonForkBS2": "この先を進むために　いろいろ壊さないといけないものが　あると思うんだな",
		"RaccoonForkNoBS1": "この岩は　相当な力を加えないと　動かないと思うんだな",
		"RaccoonGhost1": "So THESE are the remnants of the ancient civilization...",
		"RaccoonGhost2": "A friendly spirit here confirmed my suspicions about what happened.",
		"RaccoonGhost3": "That the bastion of power, the great tree, was felled to suppress the island's energy!",
		"RaccoonGhost4": "It appears that despite sealing the free-flowing of power, they were unsuccessful in sealing it all.",
		"RaccoonGhost5": "This extinction serves as a warning to those who oppose a power much greater than themselves, I suppose...",
		"RaccoonHiveKey1": "This island is full of surprises.",
		"RaccoonHiveKey2": "So many ancient artifacts. More to explore!",
		"RaccoonHiveNoKey1": "このゲートは　調べるほどにわからない･･･",
		"RaccoonHiveNoKey2": "もしかしたら　村の誰かが　由来を知ってるんだな",
		"RaccoonJungle1": "東側には　古い街があるんだな",
		"RaccoonJungle2": "今を知り　理解しようとするとき　まずは過去を　理解しなければいけないんだな",
		"RaccoonJungle3": "この過去の文明は　自分たちが住んでいた魔法の国を　どう思っているのか･･･",
		"RaccoonJungle4": "謎は深まるばかり　なんだな！",
		"RaccoonJungle5": "ただ　そこにたどり着くために　この植物群を通り抜けないと　いけないんだな･･･",
		"RaccoonMountain1": "It's so odd that a tree stump could function as a mountain!",
		"RaccoonMountain2": "The snow... FEELS like snow... but also has magical properties...",
		"RaccoonMountain3": "Could the tree's former power be dispersing, creating these snow and ice creatures?",
		"RaccoonMountain4": "I wish I could find out before I freeze my caboose off!",
		"RaccoonVillageFinal1": "I have one final realization surrounding this place.",
		"RaccoonVillageFinal2": "Listen closely...",
		"RaccoonVillageFinal3": "The spirit of this place is shattered into two!",
		"RaccoonVillageFinal4": "We can feel the threads of fate being pulled from both ends, especially now.",
		"RaccoonVillageFinal5": "One is stronger than the other, however...",
		"RaccoonVillageFinal6": "The spirit of light is desperately trying to hold the spirit of darkness back...",
		"RaccoonVillageFinal7": "I think with the right push... you can make the spirit of darkness back down!",
		"RaccoonVillageFinal8": "You are the rogue chess piece of balance, the island's trump card!",
		"RaccoonVillageFinal9": "The collective spirit awaits you both in trepidation and eagerness!",
		"RaccoonVillageFinal10": "As such, I put all my faith in you!",
