		"TLdiagfoxmancmidfight2": "Let's go!",
		"TLdiagfoxmancmidfight1": "Hrm... I guess I'll have to power up for you!", 
		"TLdiagYCHbalcony1": "How goes it?",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybeachhive1": "Any other places you've been?",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybeachhive10": "I had no idea bees could get so big! Or so unfriendly...",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybeachhive11": "You'd be surprised at how tedious running for your life becomes eventually.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybeachhive12": "It was like a comedy of errors, without the comedy!",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybeachhive13": "The only place the bees stopped chasing us was the top of the mountain.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybeachhive14": "I suppose they can't stand extreme cold.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybeachhive15": "It wouldn't be so bad, but neither of us thought to pack winter clothes.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybeachhive16": "And even if we did, our luggage is still back at the village.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybeachhive17": "We thought that maybe we could take shelter in the castle up here.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybeachhive2": "Once we got to the beach, I thought we could start to have fun again.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybeachhive3": "Or at least have a breather before walking back to the village.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybeachhive4": "But, well...",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybeachhive5": "Yeah I've seen those pirates.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybeachhive6": "They're really dangerous!",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybeachhive7": "Unfortunately, yes.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybeachhive8": "Neither of us were keen on being shanked by sabers, so we ran into the forest, only to find out it was haunted.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybeachhive9": "And from there, to a cave connected to the heart of the mountain.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybv1": "Did you say you guys are on vacation here?",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybv10": "Thankfully my husband found a secret passage out, but it was so narrow, we had to crawl on our hands and feet for what felt like hours!",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybv2": "*sigh*",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybv3": "I heard about this place from one of my employees.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybv4": "Said they were here last year and it sounded like a lovely place to visit.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybv5": "And it was nice at first, but then the pigs came...", 
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybv6": "We ran into the forest and got lost.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybv7": "We tried to hide in the mines, and that worked for awhile, but as soon as the coast seemed clear, they blasted it shut.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybv8": "So we had to find another way out.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconybv9": "All while avoiding more pigs, slimes, and strange crystal creatures.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconyisland1": "Guess you've been having a bad vacation here...",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconyisland10": "After I beat down Lord Darkdread, this island will be a much safer place.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconyisland11": "More tourists can visit and have a good time!",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconyisland12": "We hope so. And we'll be very grateful for that.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconyisland13": "Good luck!",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconyisland2": "Unfortunately for us, this place is decidedly less abandoned than we previously thought.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconyisland3": "I'm not sure how long they chased us but we managed to lose them and have been hiding in this storage area ever since.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconyisland4": "And that's pretty much it.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconyisland5": "Looks like you guys went through every place on this island.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconyisland6": "That's one way of looking at it!",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconyisland7": "Either way, we're never coming here again.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconyisland8": "No offense.",
		"TLdiagYCHbalconyisland9": "Don't worry about it!",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterchat1": "Hello, Munch.",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterchatbh1": "I came to the island by boat, and heard it had valuable materials to salvage.",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterchatbh2": "Most of the lower lands were picked clean by the pigs, so I traversed the mountain.",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterchatbh3": "After the trek, I was approached by Darkdread and offered shelter at his castle.",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterchatbh4": "Soon after, he offered me a job to hunt you.",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterchatbh5": "I assumed the state of the lower island was your doing... but I guess I was misguided.",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterchatcastle1": "Lord Darkdread's castle is just up ahead.",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterchatcastle2": "The watchtower is the first structure just before the bridge.",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterchatcastle3": "Tread lightly, it's crawling with his loyal minions that lurk in every corner.",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterchatcastle4": "Be prepared, because I'm positive that there are minimal rest spots.",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterchatcastle5": "Thanks! I won't let them get the jump on me.",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterpostfight1": "Oh... guess I missed one.",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterpostfight10": "You have everything backwards.",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterpostfight11": "Hmm... Fair enough.",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterpostfight12": "The whole situation seemed strange to begin with.",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterpostfight13": "Ah well.",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterpostfight14": "Does this mean you'll let me through no problem?",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterpostfight15": "Worry not... you will have no trouble from me.",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterpostfight16": "There are plenty of other riches in the mountains for me to collect.",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterpostfight17": "Continue on your way, then.",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterpostfight18": "Alrighty.",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterpostfight2": "You're going down pointy ears!",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterpostfight3": "Hold it!",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterpostfight4": "Why should I?",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterpostfight5": "Weren't you going to hand me over to Darkdread a moment ago?",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterpostfight6": "It was my understanding that you've been causing mayhem on the island.",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterpostfight7": "It's only natural to pursue a criminal especially when a reward is offered.",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterpostfight8": "Are you saying that I'm incorrect on this assumption?",
		"TLdiagYCHbountyhunterpostfight9": "Darkdread is invading the island and depriving the villagers of their resources.",
		"TLdiagfoxmancpostfight1": "Huff...huff...",
		"TLdiagfoxmancpostfight10": "May this work in your favor for the trials ahead!",
		"TLdiagfoxmancpostfight11": "Thanks for all the help... I really appreciate it.",
		"TLdiagfoxmancpostfight12": "Aww, you're making me blush...",
		"TLdiagfoxmancpostfight13": "What are you going to do now?",
		"TLdiagfoxmancpostfight14": "Well I'd LOVE to help ya but theres a matter of my contract...",
		"TLdiagfoxmancpostfight15": "Laying a paw on DD wouldn't be in my best interest... so instead I leave it to you.",
		"TLdiagfoxmancpostfight16": "Good luck, Munch!",
		"TLdiagfoxmancpostfight2": "Well... Done...",
		"TLdiagfoxmancpostfight3": "Convinced I'm ready for this?",
		"TLdiagfoxmancpostfight4": "Hrmph....",
		"TLdiagfoxmancpostfight5": "I guess so.",
		"TLdiagfoxmancpostfight6": "I know you'll do great up there against ol' DD.",
		"TLdiagfoxmancpostfight7": "Let me teach you one final thing.",
		"TLdiagfoxmancpostfight8": "Sometimes, you can mimic your own magic if you use it the right way.",
		"TLdiagfoxmancpostfight9": "With this knowledge, you'll be able to double up your projectiles sometimes!",
		"TLdiagshifuask1": "I sense you are prepared to receive my training.",
		"TLdiagshifuaskB1": "You seem unprepared.",
		"TLdiagshifuaskB2": "Return when your max capacity has reached at least 950.",
		"TLdiagshifucomplete1": "There is nothing more I can teach you.",
		"TLdiagshifucomplete2": "The rest of your journey of growth is up to you.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainA1": "Good.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainA10": "When you become a master of your own body, you can achieve great things.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainA11": "I bet you can grow much larger.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainA12": "*Huff*.. Amazing!",
		"TLdiagshifutrainA13": "P-please teach me!!!",
		"TLdiagshifutrainA14": "Alright then...",
		"TLdiagshifutrainA15": "Let's begin.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainA2": "Now... show me how big you can get!",
		"TLdiagshifutrainA3": "Alright. Here we go!",
		"TLdiagshifutrainAA3": "This is as large as I can get right now...",
		"TLdiagshifutrainA4": "*Huff huff*...",
		"TLdiagshifutrainA5": "*Heh... pretty impressive, huh?",
		"TLdiagshifutrainA6": "Very.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainA7": "However, you are still not at your full potential.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainA8": "Woah!",
		"TLdiagshifutrainA9": "You make it look so effortless!",
		"TLdiagshifutrainB1": "This training is a classic and a good way to increase your resiliency.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainB2": "It will give me insight on your current limits.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainB3": "Hnnnghh!!",
		"TLdiagshifutrainC1": "Even in this cold pond, you must be able to harness your energy...",
		"TLdiagshifutrainC2": "Brrr...",
		"TLdiagshifutrainC3": "So cold...!",
		"TLdiagshifutrainC4": "Silence...",
		"TLdiagshifutrainC5": "Focus on your inner peace...",
		"TLdiagshifutrainD1": "How do you feel?",
		"TLdiagshifutrainD2": "Hmm... this is tolerable.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainD3": "Then... how about this?",
		"TLdiagshifutrainD4": "Urrrph...!",
		"TLdiagshifutrainE1": "Grr...",
		"TLdiagshifutrainE2": "This is quite... difficult...",
		"TLdiagshifutrainE3": "Part of being large is fighting the weight of clumsiness.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainE4": "You must maintain balance and form.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainF1": "What lesson is this, Sifu?",
		"TLdiagshifutrainF2": "Chomp chomp...",
		"TLdiagshifutrainF3": "You can't skip out on good food if you want your body to recover!",
		"TLdiagshifutrainF4": "Of course!",
		"TLdiagshifutrainF5": "Chomp chomp...",
		"TLdiagshifutrainF6": "This is my favorite training!",
		"TLdiagshifutrainF7": "Chomp chomp...",
		"TLdiagshifutrainT1": "Now, calm your mind...",
		"TLdiagshifutrainT10": "I feel like... I'm going to explode...!",
		"TLdiagshifutrainT11": "You can do it...",
		"TLdiagshifutrainT12": "This is the final push...",
		"TLdiagshifutrainT13": "Huff... I... I did it!",
		"TLdiagshifutrainT14": "Quite impressive indeed.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainT15": "It's great! ...",
		"TLdiagshifutrainT16": "Erf... one problem, though...",
		"TLdiagshifutrainT17": "I can't seem to get up...",
		"TLdiagshifutrainT18": "I said I could help you hold more.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainT19": "I didn't say anything about movement.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainT2": "Accept all things that come to you.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainT20": "Aw, that's disappointing...",
		"TLdiagshifutrainT21": "This stage of growth is a defense mechanism, after all.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainT22": "It will allow you to retaliate by shooting projectiles rapidly to get back to mobility.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainT23": "I guess that's true...",
		"TLdiagshifutrainT24": "Now, can you help me deflate?",
		"TLdiagshifutrainT3": "Alright... Here we go...",
		"TLdiagshifutrainT4": "This was your limit before.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainT5": "Are you ready to proceed?",
		"TLdiagshifutrainT6": "Huff... heh... of course...",
		"TLdiagshifutrainT7": "Open your mind, unite with nature...",
		"TLdiagshifutrainT8": "Water... Fire... Wind...",
		"TLdiagshifutrainT9": "Mrphhh...!",
		"TLdiagshifutrainpostT1": "Thanks for the training!",
		"TLdiagshifutrainpostT10": "That's gonna be awesome!",
		"TLdiagshifutrainpostT11": "This is all I can do for you, however.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainpostT12": "Now... Proceed.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainpostT13": "I wish you good luck on your quest.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainpostT14": "Thanks a lot, Sifu!",
		"TLdiagshifutrainpostT2": "Haha, you were a great student!",
		"TLdiagshifutrainpostT3": "Almost as good as that fox lad I trained.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainpostT4": "Don't think your training is over yet, though.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainpostT5": "What do you mean?",
		"TLdiagshifutrainpostT6": "I've sensed even greater potential while you were training.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainpostT7": "You've been gathering those popper mushrooms to increase your capacity, right?",
		"TLdiagshifutrainpostT8": "If you keep finding those, you will become bigger.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainpostT9": "Perhaps even larger than me.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainpreT1": "You've learned all that I can teach.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainpreT2": "It's time for your final test.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainpreT3": "Yes. I am ready, master.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainpreT4": "We shall see if you truly have the will to pass.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainpreT5": "Dont worry, I can do it.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainpreT6": "Very good.",
		"TLdiagshifutrainpreT7": "Let us prepare.",
		"TLdiagwolfbossdefeat1": "Urggg...",
		"TLdiagwolfbossdefeat2": "Shrunken down into a beta...",
		"TLdiagyisyamountain1": "We might need to stay here until morning.",
		"TLdiagyisyamountain10": "Huh?",
		"TLdiagyisyamountain11": "What do you mean?",
		"TLdiagyisyamountain12": "Give me just a moment, I think I hear some pigs...",
		"TLdiagyisyamountain13": "That hit the spot!",
		"TLdiagyisyamountain14": "I produce a lot of heat on a full stomach, so let's warm you up a bit!",
		"TLdiagyisyamountain15": "Are you sure you don't mind?",
		"TLdiagyisyamountain16": "It's my duty to protect the villagers, isn't it? Hehe.",
		"TLdiagyisyamountain17": "Ahh, it's very comfortable!",
		"TLdiagyisyamountain18": "You're like a giant heated comfort pillow!",
		"TLdiagyisyamountain19": "He he, get some sleep.",
		"TLdiagyisyamountain2": "Yeah, I guess...",
		"TLdiagyisyamountain20": "This storm is going to last all night.",
		"TLdiagyisyamountain3": "Are you doing alright?",
		"TLdiagyisyamountain4": "Are you hungry?",
		"TLdiagyisyamountain5": "Oh no, I'm fine.",
		"TLdiagyisyamountain6": "But it's bit cold in here...",
		"TLdiagyisyamountain7": "I'm not used to this mountain weather...",
		"TLdiagyisyamountain8": "Hmm... I'm fine but pretty hungry...",
		"TLdiagyisyamountain9": "But I think I know how I can solve both of our problems!",
		"TLdiagyisyamountainmorning1": "Thanks for your help!",
		"TLdiagyisyamountainmorning2": "I'll call for To-Ri to get me now that the weather is good.",
		"TLdiagyisyamountainmorning3": "Glad to help!",
		"TLdiagyisyamountainmorning4": "I'll see you at the village later!",
		"TLdiagyisyamountainmorning5": "It was very nice camping with you!",
		"TLdiagyisyamountainmorning6": "See ya!",
		"TLdiagyisyamountainmorning7": "Well one case is solved!",
		"TLdiagyisyamountainmorning8": "Now, go back to adventure!",
		"triggerdiagwolfbosspre1": "Ahh, some fresh meat!",
		"triggerdiagwolfbosspre2": "We don't get many uninvited guests up here!",
		"triggerdiagwolfbosspre3": "I take it you operate under Darkdread as well, huh...",
		"triggerdiagwolfbosspre4": "Grrr... what an insult!",
		"triggerdiagwolfbosspre5": "Alphas don't operate under anyone!",
		"triggerdiagwolfbosspre6": "I guess I'll be on my way then.",
		"triggerdiagwolfbosspre7": "...Not so fast...",
		"triggerdiagwolfbosspre8": "...I gotta pay you back for that insult...",
		"triggerdiagwolfbosspre9": "I'll make this quick.",
