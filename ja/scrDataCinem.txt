		"cinemGOODENDeatingcontest2": "It was really fun to watch!",
		"cinemGOODENDeatingcontest3": "My belly grew a size just watching them cook!",
		"cinemGOODENDeatingcontest4": "The Great Birdman had to restrain himself from taste-testing too much!",
		"cinemGOODENDeatingcontest5": "That almost blew up into another eating contest!",
		"cinemGOODENDeatingcontest6": "Now that the island has opened its gates to tourism again, we should expect crazy exotic cuisine!",
		"cinemGOODENDeatingcontest7": "Woo, I should DEFINITELY swing down here from the castle more often then!",
		"cinemGOODENDeatingcontest8": "Hopefully they open some belly-rubbing locations too!",

		"cinemGOODENDmountain8": "Ahh forget about all that.",

		"cinemGOODENDmountain11": "By the way, milord.",
		"cinemGOODENDmountain12": "Is Noblesse Oblige your ma?",
		"cinemGOODENDmountain13": "Why not just do whatever you want, you're the strongest!",
		"cinemGOODENDmountain14": "What'd you say...?",
		"cinemGOODENDmountain15": "You haven't seen her have ya?",
		"cinemGOODENDmountain16": "Just keep your mouth shut and do what DD says.",

		"cinemGOODENDPL1": "See?",
		"cinemGOODENDPL10": "Ho ho ho, thanks for your effort!",
		"cinemGOODENDPL11": "Together we can make the island better than it ever was before!",
		"cinemGOODENDPL2": "I told you this open market will be huge boom!",
		"cinemGOODENDPL3": "Well still... I think it was better before.",
		"cinemGOODENDPL4": "When we could just take whatever we wanted!",
		"cinemGOODENDPL5": "Not again you fool!",
		"cinemGOODENDPL6": "You promised you would learn to live with others in harmony!",

		"cinemGOODENDbeach20": "C...crew...?",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach21": "...Okay I guess...",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach3": "Arr, that is an interesting idea.",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach4": "Advertising this island as a prime cruise location!",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach5": "With a REAL pirate adventure experience!",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach6": "Arr... I just wanna fish.",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach7": "I'm tired of all these heavy cannons...",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach8": "I'll be able to reopen my 'Lazy Ocean Ride' attraction again!",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach9": "All the booty will funnel into our coffers!",
		"cinemGOODENDcrystalalt41": "The surface dwellers have agreed to dial back large-scale mining.",
		"cinemGOODENDcrystalalt410": "We'll find a compromise on that front then.",
		"cinemGOODENDcrystalalt411": "To our new peace decree!",
		"cinemGOODENDcrystalalt42": "They'll also completely abandon mining operations in your territories.",
		"cinemGOODENDcrystalalt43": "Tee hee! Excellent.",
		"cinemGOODENDcrystalalt44": "Then the remaining sap of the great tree will safely remain with us.",

		"cinemGOODENDghosttower8": "Nothing stops you now!",
		"cinemGOODENDdojo1": "I knew that little one would make it.",
		"cinemGOODENDdojo2": "That guardian was capable of very hard training regiments.",
		"cinemGOODENDdojo3": "It's no surprise at all.",
		"cinemGOODENDdojo4": "I've heard the guardian's capable of being bigger than you now...",
		"cinemGOODENDdojo5": "Wha...?! No way.",
		"cinemGOODENDdojo6": "A master's capability is far beyond a pupil's!",
		"cinemGOODENDdojo7": "Hohoho, you've still got it!",
		"cinemGOODENDbee1": "I see the honey trade contract has been accepted.",
		"cinemGOODENDbee10": "No time to get bored! My favorite was that Mighty Flying Super Cow series.",
		"cinemGOODENDbee11": "Hmm, alright, I'll take your word for it...",
		"cinemGOODENDbee2": "Yes, my queen.",
		"cinemGOODENDbee3": "They agreed to plant a large flower field in exchange.",

		"cinemGOODENDbee7": "Me already??",
		"cinemGOODENDbee8": "Ugh... it's such a boring job!",
		"cinemGOODENDbee9": "Don't worry, that tele-beesion thing we got from the villagers shows a lot of interesting things.",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit1": "Looks like you finally calmed down.",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit10": "Even beyond one's lifetime by those who follow in their footsteps.",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit11": "Yeah...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit12": "I don't know much about the spiritual aspect of this island but...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit13": "We aren't here to cause any disrespect to you or the island, madame.",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit14": "Please give us a chance.",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit15": "We'll pour our hearts into the island and make you and it proud.",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit16": "...You know...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit17": "It is impossible for me to truly understand the power that guides me.",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit18": "I'm merely a vessel and chess piece for the island and its power...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit19": "But perhaps it is my fault for misinterpreting the power that is given to me.",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit2": "I guess the sealed power is all tuckered out.",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit20": "...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit21": "Was I tasked with guiding you to entrap the island's power yet again?",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit22": "I'm not so sure...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit23": "Perhaps it was time to release the island's fury all along...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit24": "To break the cycle and start anew...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit25": "Maybe the island chose to forgive, but I had not...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit26": "...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit27": "Very well... I shall leave the island in your clearly capable hands.",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit28": "Nourish it and protect it... Respect it like the ancients failed to do...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit29": "Is it... over?",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit3": "...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit30": "I sense truth in her statements.",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit31": "If that's not a welcoming statement I don't know what is.",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit32": "Looks like me crew have somethin' to look forward to!",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit33": "Does this mean I gotta be NICE now?!",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit34": "Aww shucks...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit35": "To the future of the island and all of us on it!",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit4": "...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit5": "I don't exactly know what happened to you...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit6": "But on behalf of the island I'd like to apologize for what the ancient people did to you...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit7": "I'm sure we can build a new relationship with the island that the ancients overlooked.",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit8": "Everyone makes mistakes...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit9": "But mistakes can be fixed.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase1": "Yeah this is delicious!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase10": "Maybe I can try my hand at traveling the world.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase11": "But I think I really should stay here as a guardian.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase12": "If you do decide to leave I'd love to join you if I can.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase13": "If you don't mind, of course...",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase14": "I don't mind at all!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase15": "I will have to think about my prospects here a little more first, though...",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase16": "After all, the island is in for a big change!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase17": "Huh?!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase18": "How can you...?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase19": "Hey!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase2": "You can totally take over Granny's place!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase20": "I thought you were gone!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase21": "I have decided to leave this place in the hands of you mortals.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase22": "And yet... I have one last question to you...",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase23": "Guardian.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase24": "And what's that?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase25": "Now that the island is forced to rest leaving only peace...",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase26": "The island no longer needs a guardian.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase27": "I am prepared to lift your burden as guardian if you so wish.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase28": "Wait, really?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase29": "What do you mean by that?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase3": "Oh, really? Hee hee...",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase30": "I can hear your friend's desires.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase31": "You wish to be human too... don't you?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase32": "I can grant you the aspect of mortality that you lack.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase33": "It is a difficult choice for sure... but one you're free to make.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase34": "W...what!?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase35": "Are you serious!?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase36": "I am indeed.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase37": "Will you trade your guardian aspects to be a humble mortal?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase38": "Oh wow...",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase39": "This is so unexpected...",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase4": "By the way, do you still remember what I said before?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase40": "Well, Munch?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase41": "The choice is ultimately yours.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase42": "I'd support you either way!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase5": "What was that...?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase6": "Ahh, never mind!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase7": "I was just curious if you did.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase8": "Anyways, what are you going to do from now on?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase9": "Hmm... I don't know...",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian1": "Ok, I've decided.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian10": "You've done well, good guardian.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian11": "She's gone.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian12": "I hope she finds her peace after all that's happened.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian13": "I'm sure she did.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian14": "Wanna go to home now?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian15": "I've heard new visitors have arrived!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian16": "Oh boy! The village is finally growing!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian17": "Let's go check it out!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian18": "Race ya!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian19": "H...huh?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian2": "I'll stay a guardian!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian20": "Hey, WAIT!!!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian3": "I still want to help this island as much as I can and use my powers to do it!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian4": "That's great!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian5": "The whole village would love for you to stick around!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian6": "Plus, I wouldn't be able to eat nearly as much food... hehe.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian7": "Haha, that's so you...",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian8": "Your wish will continue on.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian9": "Now, I must bid you farewell.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman1": "Ok, I've decided.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman10": "Woah!!!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman11": "Wow, this feels weird!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman12": "You look so cool!!!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman13": "I can't wait until the rest of the village sees me now!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman14": "I'm getting giddy just thinking about it!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman15": "Haha!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman16": "For sure!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman17": "They're gonna be DUMBSTRUCK!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman18": "Here's to humanity!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman2": "I want to become human!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman3": "Really...?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman4": "Wow!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman5": "I'm so happy for you!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman6": "I'll be able to become a full fledged villager and work alongside you all to make the island truly great!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman7": "Your wish will become real.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman8": "Now, I must bid you farewell.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman9": "You've done well, good guardian.",
