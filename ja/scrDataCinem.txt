		"TLdiagBADENDa3": "Yisya: At least everyone made it off in time... The pirates managed to saved everyone.",

		"TLdiagPANICfoxhole3": "I think the power of the island was released.",

		"TLdiagPANICpl1DD20": "But no, now is your time to shine!",
		"TLdiagPANICpl1DD21": "You were gifted a part of the island's power out of desperation.",

		"TLdiagPANICvillagepray2": "We should start packing and evacuate, shouldn't we?",
		"TLdiagPANICvillagepray3": "I guess I put too much faith into that guardian of ours...",
		"TLdiagPANICvillagepray4": "Looks like this might be the end of the village...",
		"TLdiagPANICvillagepray5": "No!",
		"TLdiagPANICvillagepray6": "The guardian will return... I can feel it!",
		"TLdiagPANICvillagepray7": "I believe her... I can feel the spirits reaching out to us now...",

		"TLdiagPANICvillageprayfinal16": "Ahh, I see...",
		"TLdiagPANICvillageprayfinal17": "Then the village guards will stay and protect us while you fulfill your mission.",

		"TLdiagPANICvillageprayfinal7": "Sorry I'm late!",
		"TLdiagPANICvillageprayfinal8": "How is everyone?",
		"TLdiagPANICvillageprayfinal9": "Ahh, guardian... Right on time as usual!",
		"TLdiagFOXHOLEoutmeeting1": "Hey...",
		"TLdiagFOXHOLEoutmeeting10": "I guess that's true...",
		"TLdiagFOXHOLEoutmeeting11": "The island has gotten so chaotic. I find trusting anyone difficult.",
		"TLdiagFOXHOLEoutmeeting12": "Bearing the responsibility of the kids doesn't help.",
		"TLdiagFOXHOLEoutmeeting13": "I suppose so.",
		"TLdiagFOXHOLEoutmeeting14": "But if you want to restore peace, I don't understand why you're inconveniencing me all the time.",
		"TLdiagFOXHOLEoutmeeting15": "Your existence is a gift to the island in the form of a sapling.",
		"TLdiagFOXHOLEoutmeeting16": "You weren't delivered here 'ready to win', and I'm sure you realize that after your scuffle with Darkdread.",
		"TLdiagFOXHOLEoutmeeting17": "If anyone can unlock your potential, I can.",
		"TLdiagFOXHOLEoutmeeting18": "That is my true goal.",
		"TLdiagFOXHOLEoutmeeting19": "Well, for what it's worth, I appreciate it.",
		"TLdiagFOXHOLEoutmeeting2": "Sorry about my nephews and niece.",
		"TLdiagFOXHOLEoutmeeting20": "I'll take Darkdread down one way or another.",
		"TLdiagFOXHOLEoutmeeting21": "I'm sure you will.",
		"TLdiagFOXHOLEoutmeeting22": "Anyways, come inside and rest.",
		"TLdiagFOXHOLEoutmeeting23": "Tomorrow is a new day, and you have villains to beat up.",
		"TLdiagFOXHOLEoutmeeting24": "Sure thing.",
		"TLdiagFOXHOLEoutmeeting3": "Nah, it's okay.",
		"TLdiagFOXHOLEoutmeeting4": "They're cute.",
		"TLdiagFOXHOLEoutmeeting5": "I feel like I misjudged you, ya know?",
		"TLdiagFOXHOLEoutmeeting6": "I didn't really think you had the qualities of a guardian at first.",
		"TLdiagFOXHOLEoutmeeting7": "I assumed you were just going to go overboard and end up as bad as Darkdread.",
		"TLdiagFOXHOLEoutmeeting8": "Us guardians have a static slate of conscience.",
		"TLdiagFOXHOLEoutmeeting9": "We can't be compared to those mortal in nature, I'm sure you know that.",

		"TLdiagfoodcontestA2": "I'm your stand-in host today, Sugar!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestA20": "And last but not least, Munch!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestA21": "What's your story, little guy?",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestA22": "This looks really fun!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestA23": "I'm ready to dig in!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestA24": "You look like you could barely handle a single watermelon...",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestA25": "Are you sure you want to do this?",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestA26": "Ha, don't worry about me!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestA27": "I'm sure you'll be pleasantly surprised.",

		"TLdiagfoodcontestA7": "How did I get here?",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestA8": "I smelled tons of food and now I've found myself between two types of white meat!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestA9": "Neat!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestB1": "Hello everyone, and welcome to the 7th annual Bountiful Harvest Eating Contest rematch!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestB2": "Our contestants are ready to give it another go to break the four-way tie!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestB3": "You already know the drill and our competitors, so without further ado, let's begin!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestB4": "EAT! EAT! EEEAT!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestloss1": "It appears we're at the finale, folks!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestloss10": "But Munch seems to still be in the running!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestloss11": "Munch, if you can eat just one more, you will win!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestloss12": "OH MY GOD!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestloss13": "HE EXPLODED!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestloss2": "And it looks like we're at a four-way tie, how exciting!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestloss3": "Let's see how the contestants are doing!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestloss4": "Huff... I'm so full...",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestloss5": "Can't eat another bite...",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestloss6": "Waiter? I'll take my check now please... ",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestloss7": "It appears the Great Birdman might have indulged too much...",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestloss8": "Ohhh... My stomach... *urp*",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestloss9": "Well, it looks like they're out of room.",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin1": "It appears we're at the finale, folks!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin10": "But Munch seems to still be in the running.",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin11": "Munch, if you can eat just one more and not explode this time, you will win!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin12": "You can do it!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin13": "Hold it in!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin14": "Uh oh...",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin15": "Oh wow!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin16": "Congratulations!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin17": "We have a winner!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin18": "I keep losing to this... pipsqueak!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin19": "This service is terrible...",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin2": "Again!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin20": "I'd leave without paying if I could...",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin21": "I... need some rest...",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin22": "No more contests for awhile...",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin23": "Give it up for Munch!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin24": "Yeah!!!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin25": "Well done!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin26": "Now I'm hungry...",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin27": "Good job!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin28": "Woo!!!",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin3": "And it looks like we're at a four-way tie.",

		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin6": "Huff... My gut might be smaller than I thought... *urp*",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin7": "Waiter? I'm still waiting on that check... ",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin8": "Ohhh... Why do I do this to myself...",
		"TLdiagfoodcontestwin9": "Like last time, it looks like they're out of room...",
		"cinemGOODENDeatingcontest1": "Well, that was very interesting cooking event.",
		"cinemGOODENDeatingcontest2": "It was really fun to watch!",
		"cinemGOODENDeatingcontest3": "My belly grew a size just watching them cook!",
		"cinemGOODENDeatingcontest4": "The Great Birdman had to restrain himself from taste-testing too much!",
		"cinemGOODENDeatingcontest5": "That almost blew up into another eating contest!",
		"cinemGOODENDeatingcontest6": "Now that the island has opened its gates to tourism again, we should expect crazy exotic cuisine!",
		"cinemGOODENDeatingcontest7": "Woo, I should DEFINITELY swing down here from the castle more often then!",
		"cinemGOODENDeatingcontest8": "Hopefully they open some belly-rubbing locations too!",
		"cinemGOODENDeatingcontest9": "The Falcon Express will have a completely full schedule!",
		"cinemGOODENDeatingcontest10": "Better prepare my wings for it!",
		"cinemGOODENDmountain1": "So, that's the order I got from Noblesse Oblige.",
		"cinemGOODENDmountain2": "We dragon and wyverns gotta keep the order of society.",
		"cinemGOODENDmountain3": "Gah that's not fun.",
		"cinemGOODENDmountain4": "I wanna blast things with magic!",
		"cinemGOODENDmountain5": "It was never said that we shouldn't use force when necessary.",
		"cinemGOODENDmountain6": "After all, I do owe that little brat a good one...",
		"cinemGOODENDmountain7": "I will show my TRUE true power to them someday!",
		"cinemGOODENDmountain8": "Ahh forget about all that.",
		"cinemGOODENDmountain9": "Let's just indulge in the humans' cooking instead!",
		"cinemGOODENDmountain10": "Better to be fat than angry!",
		"cinemGOODENDmountain11": "By the way, milord.",
		"cinemGOODENDmountain12": "Is Noblesse Oblige your ma?",
		"cinemGOODENDmountain13": "Why not just do whatever you want, you're the strongest!",
		"cinemGOODENDmountain14": "What'd you say...?",
		"cinemGOODENDmountain15": "You haven't seen her have ya?",
		"cinemGOODENDmountain16": "Just keep your mouth shut and do what DD says.",
		"cinemGOODENDmountain17": "Speaking of that, I should go visit her in person...",
		"cinemGOODENDmountain18": "Gotta tell her how amazing I was as a mighty guardian! Ha ha!",
		"cinemGOODENDfox1": "So, we can finally go out and play!?",
		"cinemGOODENDfox2": "Yup, everything has been handled!",
		"cinemGOODENDfox3": "Let's go to the beach!",
		"cinemGOODENDfox4": "Nah let's go to the market.",
		"cinemGOODENDfox5": "I'm sooo hungry!",
		"cinemGOODENDfox6": "Hmm... I might try to visit village for once...",
		"cinemGOODENDfox7": "You just wanna go see Munch, dontcha? Hehe.",
		"cinemGOODENDfox8": "He DOES makes a good reading couch.",
		"cinemGOODENDfox9": "Go wherever your paws lead ya!",
		"cinemGOODENDfox10": "Can we travel beyond the island now?",
		"cinemGOODENDfox11": "Yup, we can visit the rest of the family again soon.",
		"cinemGOODENDfox12": "Heck yeah!",
		"cinemGOODENDPL1": "See?",
		"cinemGOODENDPL10": "Ho ho ho, thanks for your effort!",
		"cinemGOODENDPL11": "Together we can make the island better than it ever was before!",
		"cinemGOODENDPL2": "I told you this open market will be huge boom!",
		"cinemGOODENDPL3": "Well still... I think it was better before.",
		"cinemGOODENDPL4": "When we could just take whatever we wanted!",
		"cinemGOODENDPL5": "Not again you fool!",
		"cinemGOODENDPL6": "You promised you would learn to live with others in harmony!",
		"cinemGOODENDPL7": "Sheesh I was bein' sarcastic!",
		"cinemGOODENDPL8": "I knew this island could be big trading hub.",
		"cinemGOODENDPL9": "I've already contacted merchants I know from other islands.",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach1": "That's what I've got planned!", 
		"cinemGOODENDbeach10": "Just need to control our desire to pickpocket those pretty shinys... Har har!",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach11": "No more stealing, please!",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach12": "You gotta build a strong reputation with your customers.",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach13": "Like I do with my fantastic dishes.",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach14": "And err... by the way captain...",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach15": "Speak up me hardy. What?",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach16": "W... wanna drop by my place sometime?",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach17": "I'll prepare those cool lemonades you liked!",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach18": "Arrr, sure!",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach19": "Just prepare plenty for me whole crew!",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach2": "What do you think?",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach20": "C...crew...?",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach21": "...Okay I guess...",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach3": "Arr, that is an interesting idea.",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach4": "Advertising this island as a prime cruise location!",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach5": "With a REAL pirate adventure experience!",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach6": "Arr... I just wanna fish.",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach7": "I'm tired of all these heavy cannons...",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach8": "I'll be able to reopen my 'Lazy Ocean Ride' attraction again!",
		"cinemGOODENDbeach9": "All the booty will funnel into our coffers!",
		"cinemGOODENDcrystalalt41": "The surface dwellers have agreed to dial back large-scale mining.",
		"cinemGOODENDcrystalalt410": "We'll find a compromise on that front then.",
		"cinemGOODENDcrystalalt411": "To our new peace decree!",
		"cinemGOODENDcrystalalt42": "They'll also completely abandon mining operations in your territories.",
		"cinemGOODENDcrystalalt43": "Tee hee! Excellent.",
		"cinemGOODENDcrystalalt44": "Then the remaining sap of the great tree will safely remain with us.",
		"cinemGOODENDcrystalalt45": "Just try not to jump into peoples' mouths anymore, okay?",
		"cinemGOODENDcrystalalt46": "Well... we'll try.",
		"cinemGOODENDcrystalalt47": "We're so tasty that we can't make any promises though, hehe!",
		"cinemGOODENDcrystalalt48": "They are pretty tasty to be honest...",
		"cinemGOODENDcrystalalt49": "Like green apple candy.",
		"cinemGOODENDghosttower1": "The ancient curse is finally lifted!",
		"cinemGOODENDghosttower2": "Go on my little ones! We're free!",
		"cinemGOODENDghosttower3": "I think I'll stay here and watch the living for awhile longer.",

		"cinemGOODENDghosttower5": "I'm ready to be released!",
		"cinemGOODENDghosttower6": "Goodbye all!",
		"cinemGOODENDghosttower7": "Choose your own way!",
		"cinemGOODENDghosttower8": "Nothing stops you now!",
		"cinemGOODENDdojo1": "I knew that little one would make it.",
		"cinemGOODENDdojo2": "That guardian was capable of very hard training regiments.",
		"cinemGOODENDdojo3": "It's no surprise at all.",
		"cinemGOODENDdojo4": "I've heard the guardian's capable of being bigger than you now...",
		"cinemGOODENDdojo5": "Wha...?! No way.",
		"cinemGOODENDdojo6": "A master's capability is far beyond a pupil's!",
		"cinemGOODENDdojo7": "Hohoho, you've still got it!",
		"cinemGOODENDbee1": "I see the honey trade contract has been accepted.",
		"cinemGOODENDbee10": "No time to get bored! My favorite was that Mighty Flying Super Cow series.",
		"cinemGOODENDbee11": "Hmm, alright, I'll take your word for it...",
		"cinemGOODENDbee2": "Yes, my queen.",
		"cinemGOODENDbee3": "They agreed to plant a large flower field in exchange.",
		"cinemGOODENDbee4": "Not bad, not bad.",
		"cinemGOODENDbee5": "Hopefully the developments will allow for more expansion into the mountain.",
		"cinemGOODENDbee6": "Your majesty, I'm here to pick up unit 5530 for honey storage duty.",
		"cinemGOODENDbee7": "Me already??",
		"cinemGOODENDbee8": "Ugh... it's such a boring job!",
		"cinemGOODENDbee9": "Don't worry, that tele-beesion thing we got from the villagers shows a lot of interesting things.",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit1": "Looks like you finally calmed down.",

		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit12": "I don't know much about the spiritual aspect of this island but...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit13": "We aren't here to cause any disrespect to you or the island, madame.",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit14": "Please give us a chance.",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit15": "We'll pour our hearts into the island and make you and it proud.",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit16": "...You know...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit17": "It is impossible for me to truly understand the power that guides me.",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit18": "I'm merely a vessel and chess piece for the island and its power...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit19": "But perhaps it is my fault for misinterpreting the power that is given to me.",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit2": "I guess the sealed power is all tuckered out.",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit20": "...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit21": "Was I tasked with guiding you to entrap the island's power yet again?",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit22": "I'm not so sure...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit23": "Perhaps it was time to release the island's fury all along...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit24": "To break the cycle and start anew...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit25": "Maybe the island chose to forgive, but I had not...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit26": "...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit27": "Very well... I shall leave the island in your clearly capable hands.",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit28": "Nourish it and protect it... Respect it like the ancients failed to do...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit29": "Is it... over?",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit3": "...",

		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit35": "To the future of the island and all of us on it!",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit4": "...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit5": "I don't exactly know what happened to you...",
		"cinemGOODENDwhitespirit6": "But on behalf of the island I'd like to apologize for what the ancient people did to you...",

		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase18": "How can you...?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase19": "Hey!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase2": "You can totally take over Granny's place!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase20": "I thought you were gone!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase21": "I have decided to leave this place in the hands of you mortals.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase22": "And yet... I have one last question to you...",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase23": "Guardian.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase24": "And what's that?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase25": "Now that the island is forced to rest leaving only peace...",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase26": "The island no longer needs a guardian.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase27": "I am prepared to lift your burden as guardian if you so wish.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase28": "Wait, really?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase29": "What do you mean by that?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase3": "Oh, really? Hee hee...",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase30": "I can hear your friend's desires.",

		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase32": "I can grant you the aspect of mortality that you lack.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase33": "It is a difficult choice for sure... but one you're free to make.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase34": "W...what!?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase35": "Are you serious!?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase36": "I am indeed.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase37": "Will you trade your guardian aspects to be a humble mortal?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase38": "Oh wow...",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase39": "This is so unexpected...",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase4": "By the way, do you still remember what I said before?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase40": "Well, Munch?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase41": "The choice is ultimately yours.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase42": "I'd support you either way!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase5": "What was that...?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase6": "Ahh, never mind!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase7": "I was just curious if you did.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase8": "Anyways, what are you going to do from now on?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicbase9": "Hmm... I don't know...",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian1": "Ok, I've decided.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian10": "You've done well, good guardian.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian11": "She's gone.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian12": "I hope she finds her peace after all that's happened.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian13": "I'm sure she did.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian14": "Wanna go to home now?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian15": "I've heard new visitors have arrived!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian16": "Oh boy! The village is finally growing!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian17": "Let's go check it out!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian18": "Race ya!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian19": "H...huh?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian2": "I'll stay a guardian!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian20": "Hey, WAIT!!!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian3": "I still want to help this island as much as I can and use my powers to do it!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian4": "That's great!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian5": "The whole village would love for you to stick around!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian6": "Plus, I wouldn't be able to eat nearly as much food... hehe.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian7": "Haha, that's so you...",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian8": "Your wish will continue on.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnicguardian9": "Now, I must bid you farewell.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman1": "Ok, I've decided.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman10": "Woah!!!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman11": "Wow, this feels weird!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman12": "You look so cool!!!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman13": "I can't wait until the rest of the village sees me now!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman14": "I'm getting giddy just thinking about it!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman15": "Haha!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman16": "For sure!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman17": "They're gonna be DUMBSTRUCK!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman18": "Here's to humanity!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman2": "I want to become human!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman3": "Really...?",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman4": "Wow!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman5": "I'm so happy for you!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman6": "I'll be able to become a full fledged villager and work alongside you all to make the island truly great!",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman7": "Your wish will become real.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman8": "Now, I must bid you farewell.",
		"cinemGOODENDpicnichuman9": "You've done well, good guardian.",
